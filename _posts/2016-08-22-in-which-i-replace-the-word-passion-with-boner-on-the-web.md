<h3>In Which I Replace the Word ‘Passion’ with ‘Boner’ on the Web</h3>
<h4>Because I have a “passion” for poking fun.</h4>
<p>An old piece of writing lore says that Mark Twain once claimed that the word ‘very’ was unnecessary in most writing. He apparently said the following:</p>
<blockquote>Substitute ‘damn’ every time you’re inclined to write ‘very’; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be purely lore, and apparently Twain put it in writing. Rather, <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/29/substitute-damn/" target="_blank">it was a newspaper editor named William Allen White who gave the advice.</a></p>
<p>But you don’t really care about all that, do you? I understand. You came here for the ‘boner’ that I promised in the title — and I shall deliver.</p>
<h4>The Rules of the Game</h4>
<p>So here are the simple rules. Please don’t break them if you choose to respond below, or tweet along, so that this piece stays classy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an article, bio, or headline that prominently features the word ‘passion’.</li>
<li>For each occurrence of the word ‘passion’, substitute the word ‘boner’.</li>
<li>Either text or a modified screenshot is fine.</li>
<li>Omit as much identifying information as possible (author, company name, etc.) out of respect. The exception would be public figures with celebrity status — because dealing with this kind of jib-jab is part of their job description. Also, they’ll probably never see it anyway.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Here are a few examples to get you rolling:</h4>

The aim is to point out one thing: just like the word ‘very’, the word ‘passion’ has been used almost to death. Consider this the stake in its passionate heart.</p>

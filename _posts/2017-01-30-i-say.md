<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Public Domain</figcaption></figure><p>I say<br>I <em>do</em> say<br>If I do say so myself.</p>
<p>Do you say?<br>Does <em>who</em> say?<br>If I say, I betray my stealth.</p>
<p>I am, a gamble<br>For lack of bettors<br>or just better<br>whether a writer, or mere typesetter.</p>
<p>I am, then</p>
<p>The best of of what the worst could be<br>The rest of what there used to be<br>The nest from which so few can see<br>Don’t waste your strength to get to me<br>Because there is no <em>me</em>, you see?</p>
<p>They say the most romantic men were genocidal<br>I say that most permanence is tidal<br>Truth, then what?<br>Truth, then what?!</p>
<p>When I say<br>What <em>you</em> say<br>It gets around<br>To you.</p>
<p>It does, but when?</p>
<p>In due time<br>In whose time?<br>Undoubtedly, a fool’s time.</p>

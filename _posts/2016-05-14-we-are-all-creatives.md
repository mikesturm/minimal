<h4>We just have to realize it</h4>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kandinsky, “<em>Small Worlds I”</em>, 1922</figcaption></figure><p>I think and write a lot about creativity these days, as do numerous others around the web. Sometimes we write things that assume a separation between those doing “creative work” and, well, everyone else. However, I have my doubts that there really is such a separation. Furthermore, I think that believing in such a separation may actually be harmful — to everyone.</p>
<blockquote><em>We are all “creatives”.</em></blockquote>
<p>There is a place in <em>all</em> of our work for creativity. Every kind of work can benefit from it. In fact, it is those jobs where we often <em>don’t</em> see a need for creativity that most badly need a creative touch. That elusive and desirable thing that so many in the business world chase — innovation — is often a direct result of creative thinking in the very places that no one expects it. This is because creativity is what makes us human.</p>
<h3>Reason is Dead</h3>
<p>Creativity is really an inclination more than anything. It’s a mode of thinking — one that refuses to take on assumptions without question, that looks for the new and untested rather than the traditional and accepted. Creativity involves embracing risk, venturing out into the deep end, past the ropes that others have set up to mark off the safe areas in which to swim.</p>
<p>But just to be clear here, the most creative people can often venture out past the boundaries without even realizing — or even caring. This is because some of the best creative work comes as the result of one thing: <em>play</em>.</p>
<p>It used to be that <em>reason</em> was the uniquely human trait. It was what separated us from the other complex organisms. Since the advent of sophisticated computers, that trait seems to have been perfected by the machines. With computers being able to “think through” problems and solve them, reasoning has become the arena in which humans consistently come in second place.</p>
<p>That means that it is not reason — logical thinking — but ceative thinkig where humans have the edge. We humble humans may be slowed down by tricky syllogisms, but only we can make up ideas from whole cloth. Only we can throw off the shackles of established thought.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://deepmind.com/alpha-go" target="_blank">the recent victory of machine over human in the realm of the game <em>Go</em></a> has caused many commentators to say that perhaps creativity is not solely the realm of human minds. Machines seem to be able to come up with things out-of-the-blue and surprise us.</p>
<p>But let’s not get it twisted: machines may be able to surprise us — and do something we didn’t expect — but they <em>cannot</em> play like we can. Machines have yet to be able to let loose, and work without a purpose in mind, without directives — which is <em>true</em> play.</p>
<p>However much a machine’s thought process can seem to incorporate more and varied strings of reasoning, it must still follow the linear progression powered by program, by purpose. It must follow instructions. <strong>The advantage that a human mind has over that of a machine is its ability to realize, but then abandon purpose and simply <em>play</em> with ideas.</strong></p>
<h3>The Power of Play</h3>
<p>You are not a computer. You can color without a set of lines and instructions. The sky can be polka-dotted, the clouds can be striped. You can abandon rules and conventions — at least for a time. You can disrupt and ideate in a way that a programmed machine cannot.</p>
<p>So if you’re still reading this, remember and hold dear this edict:</p>
<blockquote><em>I can create something new. I can wander for the sake of wandering. I have that uniquely human power.</em></blockquote>
<p>So use it. Observe and note the lines — understand them — then color outside of them. Do so without regard for what the goal is — the goal is simply to wander. Everything else is secondary. I think you will find that enough of that wandering will yield some truly wonderful things. Those things can then be injected back into the humdrum activities of daily life for whatever goals you have adopted. Or perhaps, they will reveal entirely <em>new</em> goals toward which to strive.</p>
<p>Go forth and play. Know the rules and abandon them for a spell. Swim in that uncharted water, then return and tell us what you found.</p>
<p>Godspeed.</p>

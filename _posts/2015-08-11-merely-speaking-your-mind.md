He's fired...up!

There is a refrain that I’ve heard time and again, in various contexts, and about various people. It is a refrain that grates against the grey matter of my brain each time I hear it uttered. It goes something like this:

> Say what you will about X, but he/she speaks his/her mind!

Another variation, which is a bit more dastardly

> Man, he says the things that no one else has the guts to say!

Against both of these general refrains, I call the strongest of fouls. There is no virtue in merely speaking your mind. There is also no virtue in saying things that no one else “has the guts” to say.

In fact, the more you’re speaking, the less you’re probably *thinking*. As the old adage goes: (s)he who speaks the most often *says* the least! And those pungent farts of thoughtless anti-wisdom that you choose to belt out are probably not being said by others for a reason: they stink. It’s not that others don’t have the guts, it’s that they have the restraint to consider whether what they’re thinking is utter bulls#!@%.

This point is of particular relevance now, given the current Republican Party primary in the U.S., leading up to next year’s presidential election. I won’t name names, but savvy readers (0r those who looked at the title picture) will get my drift. There is a candidate whose entire platform seems to be that he says whatever’s on his mind, and often those are things that others are afraid to say. Well, there is a reason why others are afraid to say them: because they’re thoughtless drivel! Quasi-racist, culturally ignorant, misogynisitc aphorisms are of no value, and that’s why others in the public eye don’t say them. It’s not that they don’t have the guts, it’s that they don’t wish to say stupid s#!@ in public.

To sum up. The next time someone tells you that they appreciate the office buffoon or the a**hole drunk uncle character because “at least they speak their mind!”, that doesn’t mean a damn thing.

> All it means is that they don’t think before they speak, and if they do, they don’t bother to ask whether they know what they’re talking about. I fail to see how that is at all a positive trait.

That’s not to say that we all don’t trip up and speak out of turn here and there; we do, and that’s fine. However, for one’s main appeal to that they just spout off without thinking, well that’s just unfortunate for them---perhaps more unfortunate for those who admire it.

Think about what you’re going to say, as much as you can. The more people you know will hear it, the more you ought to think about it. And if someone tries to tell you that some public figure is admirable because they “speak their mind,” just remind them---if you’re feeling particularly cynical---“so did Hitler.”

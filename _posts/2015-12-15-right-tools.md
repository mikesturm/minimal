For at least the past 5 years, I have become intensely focused on what tools I'm using for given jobs. This focus bleeds into every area of my life, from how I make my morning coffee to how I enjoy podcasts, and all of the important work in between. There are times when this focus robs me of the focus and time that I need in order to actually *do* the things that I need to be doing. I don't *like* that this happens, but it does, and now more than before, I am able to curb that. However, I do not curb that robbery at the cost of finding the right tool---I can't. My inclination is to find something that yields the best work with the least overall headache.  Below is a list of tools that I have found---for now---which I believe provide the best path to what I am aiming to do.

- **Markdown in plain .txt files** - I have written in numerous word processors, on countless internet publishing platforms, and I was never able to seamlessly take text from one platform to another without degradation. This is a problem because when I write something, I want it to survive *as I intended it to exist*, regardless of what Microsoft, Apple, or Google do to their various programs. I also want my writing to be readable in its raw form (where "raw" here means *before it is passed through a program and spit out as output in a different GUI").

- **Jekyll and Github** - I've been writing stuff on the internet for over 10 years now. Now, that doesn't mean that anybody has *read* what I've written, but what it *does* mean is that I've been doing it long enough to see the rise and fall of many blogging platforms and website services. Here's a quick rundown of what I've used:

	- Livejournal (yeah, remember that?)
	- Blogger
	- Tumblr
	- Squarespace
	- Weebly
	- Medium  

	These are all still around, and some are really great for certain purposes, but my issue with them has been twofold: (1) a lack of accessible code that is manipulable by the coding layperson and (2) versatility to build a website and blog as a clearly organized series of files.

	When you set up a site with [Github](https://github.com), and compile it using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the whole shootin' match is (relatively) local---in that it's on your repository. Blogging is simple, it's just a matter of saving a new .md file in your "posts" directory, with a proper date format in the file name, and committing the change to your project.

	I'm not going to mince words; there is a learning curve---especially if you're not familiar with html or css at all. However, I know *relatively* little HTML and CSS, and I got the hang of it after about a week of sporadic tinkering. Now this very site is run through Jekyll on my Github repository ([which you can fork](https://github.com/mikesturm/mikesturm.github.io), if you like).

- **Workflowy** - There's no arena in which going down a rabbit-hole of customization and tinkering is *more* antithetical to what you're trying to do than in task management software. There was a time when I was always looking for the coolest, most off-beat, cross-platform, color-coded nonsense out there---and I found them...all of them. I used Toodledo, Wanderlist, ToDoist, Trello, Nirvana, Google Tasks, and so many others I forgot. Some of them, I literally used for a half a day. I read *Getting Things Done*, as I'll bet anyone reading this post has, and it cemented the importance of organization and finding a system you like to get you to be productive. Well, that search took me many places, but I finally settled on [Workflowy](http://Workflowy.com).

	Workflowy is outstanding. It is everything I was looking for in *both* a task management and thinking/organization medium. I won't bore you with my gushing about how may things it lets you do with so little options, but really, *that's* the trick of it. It lets you do something that I haven't seen any other task management or organization entity let you do (at least not as easily): infinitely outline and reorganize items. Have a project that has subtasks nested to the n^th degree? Go for it. You can then zoom in to the lowest level as if it were its *own* sheet of paper. Just try it for yourself. The one caveat is that they don't have reminders. You can tweak it to just about anything else using hashtags and hyperlinks, but you can't make it remind you of something. You know what, though? I actually *prefer* that. I am not so sure that I need to make it easy for myself to make a task that *could* be done some other time into a thing that my phone buzzes me about at 6pm while I'm eating, and thus ignoring it. I'll take that trade-off any day.

- **nvAlt, Simplenote, and ResophNotes** - I was first turned on to [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) well before I made the conversion to using a Mac for computing. This had to be some time early on in the life of the [*Back to Work*](http://5by5.tv/b2w) podcast, where Merlin Mann mentioned it as part of his workflow. I love the principle of saving everything in plain text format, in one folder, and writing it all in markdown format. nvAlt is fantastic, but there is no app for iOS, so one needs to use [SimpleNote](http://simplenote.com) as a service to sync notes across different machines if Dropbox is either not preferred or (as is the case with me) not available on another machine one uses. My work machine is a PC, running Windows 7, and our security restrictions don't allow us to connect to Dropbox through the company network. Luckily, [ResophNotes](http://www.resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) can install without admin privileges, and---like nvAlt, syncs through SimpleNote. This setup allows me to take notes through all three of my machines---iPhone, work PC, and Mac at home---without worry of un-synced files. So far (fingers crossed) it's worked.

That's about it. I still use Evernote when I have to; there's just no smoother way to save images and attach files (though it seems that links in text files and Workflowy could one day be easy enough to use). This bundle took me a long time to establish, but it works for me now, better than any other I have tried. If you've taken the time to read this, perhaps you'll take on part or all of it, and see just how fun and easy it can be to have the right tools in your pocket---so to speak.

Godspeed.

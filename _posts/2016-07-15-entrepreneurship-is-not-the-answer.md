<h3>Entrepreneurship Is Not the Answer</h3>
<h4>As we rush to foster creativity and innovation in the next generation, let’s not chase the wrong rabbit.</h4>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You wouldn’t <em>believe his burn rate…</em></figcaption></figure><p>When I came home from college at age 19 and told my parents that I was going to change my major to philosophy, their first reaction was indignant curiosity. <em>What the hell are you going to do with that?</em> They asked me. As an idealistic 19 year-old, my initial answer didn’t involve money, so they poked me again about how I was going to make a living. I told them that I planned on making money by being a professor. I would get paid to teach, do research, and present at conferences. That was my official response anyway.</p>
<p>Secretly, I chose the major I did because I wanted to make a living playing with ideas. But I didn’t want my play with ideas to be corrupted by concerns about what was the most practical idea, what would get the most grant money, or what would be the best way to fuel the profit margins of a new or existing company. My intentions were pure. I wanted to explore the depths of the most abstract and confounding questions — and attempt to find answers for them. I wanted to be able to do that freely, and without regard to any other goal save finding the truth. How naive of me.</p>
<p>As it turns out, in the real world, truth is a secondary goal at best. Yes, the Silicon Valley set <em>loves</em> ideas. They love the idea of people who <em>love</em> ideas. But all that is secondary to a love of whatever will turn into cash from the consumer. If you’re just interested in pulling back the curtain on life’s big questions, it better be accompanied by some bits about your burn rate and scalability, or you are in for a rough ride. This wouldn’t be a problem if Silicon Valley’s model weren’t the prevailing paradigm for businesses today. Unfortunately for idea people, it is.</p>
<p>Enter the age of the entrepreneur. My kids, and my friends’ kids are going to be raised in an environment where entrepreneurs are the new movie gods and rock stars. They will be bombarded by <em>Shark Tank </em>competitions at their schools, and websites with calls for more young people to start their own companies. I have no problem with the aspect of this that focuses on nurturing creativity and innovation. What I <em>do</em> have a problem with is that the message is delivered with an undeniable and explicit connection to turning a profit.</p>
<p>My reason for being circumspect about this profit motive is that I fear that an idea explored for profit is an idea only partially pursued. What I mean here is that kids need to be able to play with ideas. By “play” I mean <em>free play</em>, where the following things are true (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200811/the-value-play-i-the-definition-play-gives-insights" target="_blank">courtesy of Dr. Peter Gray</a>):</p>
<blockquote>1. It is self-chosen and self-directed</blockquote>
<blockquote>2. It is activity in which means are more valued than ends</blockquote>
<blockquote>3. Play has structure, or rules, which are not dictated by physical necessity but emanate from the minds of the players</blockquote>
<blockquote>3. Play is imaginative, non-literal, mentally removed in some way from “real” or “serious” life; and</blockquote>
<blockquote>4. Play involves an active, alert, but non-stressed frame of mind.</blockquote>
<p>The key here is that free play is about play in a zone removed from clear and decided goals— especially those placed on us by the business world (profit and growth).</p>
<p>So yes, let’s get students excited about creativity and innovation — let’s <em>train</em> them to do those things. <strong>However</strong>, let’s not make the mistake of thinking that the way to do that is to lure them in with entrepreneurship — which is centered around the constraint of profit-seeking. Learning about entrepreneurship has its place, but its place is <em>not</em> as the basis for learning about creativity and original thought. When the goal is profit, the ideas will all start to resemble one another —which doesn’t sound either innovative or creative. When the goals are relaxed, and the mind is allowed to roam free for a while, we’ll be amazed by what the young minds bring back to us.</p>
<p>Who knows, those ideas may even make some serious money. Wouldn’t that be neat? And it would be <em>precisely </em>because that was not the original goal. Funny how that can work out, isn’t it?</p>

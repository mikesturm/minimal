  1. It is literally impossible to do both of the following things (a) Pick yourself up by the bootstraps; (b) be self-made. That being the case, don’t be so hubristic as to claim to have done either, or suggest that others do so.
  2. Everyone is aiming toward some perceived good---some form of happiness or alleviation of suffering. Don’t make the mistake of seeing others’ motives as hollow. At best it shows you to be ignorant and superficial. At worst, it denies you the ability to truly understand others.
  3. You should be able to learn something from each person you converse with. It is not only enriching for you, but the utmost form of respect for the other person.

  4. If you believe that you haven’t made any mistakes by the day’s end, you’re either forgetful, lying to yourself, or simply not trying.
  5. 95% of the time, the following will be true of any email, text, phone call, letter, tweet, post, or meeting: things will be fine without your immediate attention and reply to it.
  6. A simple trick to weed out pathological liars: they are the ones claiming to know all of the answers.
  7. Art exists because merely speaking the truth doesn’t convey the full gravity of it.
  8. Almost always say 50% less than what you feel like saying at the time, with one exception: when you feel like telling someone how much you care about them.
  9. A plan is essential to have, if only so that you can easily recognize how much and how often things don’t turn out according to it.
  10. Do not confuse Simple with Easy. The simplest problems are some of the most difficult to solve.

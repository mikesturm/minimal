Donal O'Shea, the president of New College in Florida, makes a great point about the humanities [in SRQ Magazine this week:](http://www.srqmagazine.com/srq-daily/2016-02-13/3494_The-Invisible-Humanities)

>From literature, philosophy and religion, one learns that the same fact can be interpreted in many mutually incompatible ways, and that human experience is inherently complex.
>
>In a very real sense, the humanities are the sciences of uncertainty and complexity. They teach us to live with and handle ambiguity. Their study produces outcomes that are difficult to measure, and therefore difficult to test. But those outcomes matter. It is difficult to conceive of wisdom absent them. And an education without them is at best training.
>
>And, so, it should be no surprise that the humanities are essential to data science, which seeks pattern and meaning in the large unstructured data sets that are so much a part of our times.

This is a wonderful way of putting it. There are plenty more pull quotes in the article, so please go read it if you're interested (it's a quick read). Now, this isn't a surprise, as New College is known to be pretty progressive in their curriculum. However, it represents a really good way of thinking about balancing education---one that stands in stark contrast to [this rambling train wreck on Medium by Vinod Khosla.](https://medium.com/@vkhosla/is-majoring-in-liberal-arts-a-mistake-for-students-fd9d20c8532e#.ky2q2qsyw) I commented that piece to high heaven on the site, so I won't bother to recap it here. The point is that assessments like O'Shea's need to be kept circulating as more and more as rhetorical abortions like Khosla's continue to become more prevalent.

*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets them. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

I knew it would happen. The first 4 weeks of this *Oblique Strategies* series have been smooth sailing. I've managed to randomly pick strategies that could easily be analyzed and generalized in a blog format. This week presented me with my first challenge:

> Decorate, Decorate.

Yeah. Not much to work with. But with the creative spirit burning in my soul, I trudge onward, delivering what I (foolishly) promised just over a month ago.  So without further ado...

What comes to mind when you think about the word "decoration"? I'm going to hazard guess and say that what comes to mind is the stuff that receives attention only *after* everything else seems to be in place---in other words, the *inessential*. So, could it help to take your focus off of the so-called important, essential stuff, and merely decorate? Yes, it can.


## Pressure

Pressure can help motivate you in the creative process, sure. But I have found that for any longer than a short time, pressure exhausts you; it extracts a limited amount of creative ideas, and often at the cost of your sanity. Relying on pressure to motivate you is like cognitive strip-mining. You may get something good out of it the first few go-rounds, but you leave behind a barren landscape, with little potential for sustained returns.

The strategy of decorating can work to offset the pressure-driven approach, by changing your focus to what seems like the inessential, at least for a time. So here's a way to try out the strategy.

Take a piece of work that you've kept incomplete for some time. You know the project, the one where you're just so unsure of where it's going, and how to make it work that looking at it just *pains* you. Now take a deep breath and just say the following to yourself:

"This is done, I'm just going to go back and decorate it."

Don't go back in and think about it. Don't make substantive changes. Just add bells and whistles, or trim things up a little. Keep it superficial. If your project is an essay, pretend it's done, and just look at different fonts, or change the sizes of section headings. Try a two column layout, instead of one, just go crazy.

In fact, make the mood as light as you can, like when you are *actually* decorating. Have a drink, put on some background music, and whatever you do, don't think about the substance of the work. You're just decorating.

So why would something like this work? It works because there are actually two kinds of mental muscles involved in doing creative work, and they both need rest and recovery.


## Thinker and Maker

Actually producing a thing, from conception of the idea to the actual piece of work (whatever it may be) coming into existence, involves two kinds of work from the creator: thinking and making. Each kind of work involves a different kind of mental muscle, if you will. The thinker muscle does the work of conceptualizing, hypothesizing, strategizing, and all of those abstract kinds of activity involved in creative work. The maker muscle does the work of producing the work, or of making non-substantive changes (i.e., things that don't substantively change the work). This includes "decorating".

The thing about these two muscles, in my experience, is that when you're using one, the other is minimally engaged. So, it is allowed to rest. Thus, when the thinker is at work, the maker is resting and rejuvenating, and vice versa. As with physical muscles, everyone has weak and strong muscles in different ratios, and can exercise to strengthen them. But, also as with physical muscles, rest and recovery is needed both during exercise and after, in order to stay and grow strong.

What is likely happening with projects where you just feel stuck is that your thinking muscle is overloaded by the weight that you perceive is needed to push the work forward. That means that your muscle is either fatigued, or just not properly warmed up.
The strategy of decorating works because it does two things for your thinking muscle:

1. If your thinker muscle is fatigued, it is allowed to rest, while the maker muscle does some work.
2. If your thinker muscle is just not warmed up, it allows the maker muscle to do most of the work, while the thinker muscle gets warmed up for heavier lifting.


## Two Caveats

Here's a caveat: decorating is NOT revising. So don't be tempted to invoke this strategy by way of re-reading and editing work (if your project is writing). I say this because editing, revising, or proofreading involves the thinker muscle. Thus, if you're doing work like that, you're not resting that muscle. You may *think* you are, but you're not, and you will feel it when you try to push through on the project again.

Another caveat: this strategy is not the same thing as resting or taking a break. Here, you're staying on the same project where you are stuck, and just switching which muscles are being recruited. You're not stepping away completely, and coming back with a "fresh" perspective. That strategy can work, but has its time and place. The strategy of decorating, though, can work in many situations where "taking a break" won't, or just isn't appropriate. Decorating keeps you on the project, and still working, but leverages the relationship between your different  creative mental muscles. Now get to decorating!

Godspeed.

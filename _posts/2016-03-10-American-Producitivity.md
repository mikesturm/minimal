[Quartz interviewed Northwestern economist Robert Gordon](http://qz.com/633080/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-productivity-growth/), and there a few pull quotes that I found very telling:

>By comparison, Gordon argues, today’s technological advancements—Uber, Facebook, Amazon.com—will touch the productivity of the American economy lightly—if at all. And a combination of demographic factors, such as the aging of the US population, and sociological problems such as growing inequality and educational performance that’s worsened in comparison to many other rich nations, will stymie economic growth for the foreseeable future.

I also found the below chart interesting:

You can see the real income of the bottom 90% of people in the U.S. rising more quickly in the previous 2 eras, compared to the top 10%. The top 10% have again made gains, but now there are *losses* for those in the bottom 90%. So here we have a regressive redistribution---the business we're now doing is taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich. Is that an oversimplification? Yes. But the point still stands that however much there is to be gained, it seems that the poor are not gaining it anymore. I can't imagine a reduction in people buying homes does anything but make that worse.

My point is that whereas before, the answer might have been to produce more stuff, to kick-start the economy, doing that seems like it would just put more money into the hands of the already wealthy---who are already maintaining their wealth via dividends and other rent-seeking income plans (i.e., not investing money back down to people who don't already have much).

Gordon also answered a question about [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), and how much of a law it really is:

>It’s a forecast and it’s remarkable how long it’s been accurate. Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, confirmed my conclusion that I reached from the data…that shows Moore’s law petering out.
>
And he said, “You know, it’s because computers really are fast enough to do most of what you need to do.”....When personal computers first came out, we were using floppy disks, it took forever to scan from the beginning of a document to the last page, if you wanted to change something in the conclusion.
>
All that is over now, our computers are as capable as we need. The technological drive is shifting. We’re now being held back by the limitations of batteries, and so there’s enormous technological innovation and investment in batteries now. And we don’t need it as much in computers.

To me, this seems like another thing working against productivity saving us in the future.

There's an article by Sasha Zuboff today at [FAZ.net](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616-p2.html?printPagedArticle=true) that piqued my interest because, if our future productivity gains are not in Uber or Airbnb, then is it perhaps in the thing we call *big data*? Maybe not. As Zuboff explains, that's a whole different kind of ball-game: *surveillance capitalism*:

>While surveillance capitalism taps the invasive powers of the Internet as the source of capital formation and wealth creation, it is now, as I have suggested, poised to transform commercial practice across the real world too.  An analogy is the rapid spread of mass production and administration throughout the industrialized world in the early twentieth century, but with one major caveat. Mass production was interdependent with its populations who were its consumers and employees. In contrast, surveillance capitalism preys on dependent populations who are neither its consumers nor its employees and are largely ignorant of its procedures.

The equation: First, the push for more users and more channels, services, devices, places, and spaces is imperative for access to an ever-expanding range of behavioral surplus.  Users are the human nature-al resource that provides this free raw material.  Second, the application of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science for continuous algorithmic improvement constitutes an immensely expensive, sophisticated, and exclusive twenty-first century “means of production.” Third, the new manufacturing process converts behavioral surplus into prediction products designed to predict behavior now and soon. Fourth, these prediction products are sold into a new kind of meta-market that trades exclusively in future behavior.  The better (more predictive) the product, the lower the risks for buyers, and the greater the volume of sales. Surveillance capitalism’s profits derive primarily, if not entirely, from such markets for future behavior.

I am unsure what to make of this. At first blush, it almost seems like what the future holds is fewer and fewer physical things that will require labor to manufacture, and more and more data, which requires....? Make no mistake about it, I'm not offering up a prediction here, or any real analysis. I just find that Gordon has brought up a clear trend; that trend is a setup for what Zuboff reports may be a new model for the future, and the future looks like it could be pretty weird.

Far be it from me to quote something from a comment on a comment on a [blog post about Tim Ferriss](http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01/08/5-time-management-tricks-i-learned-from-years-of-hating-tim-ferriss/), but here I go:

> I have a personal rule:
>
>When I see or hear someone going on about positivity and negativity, I pay attention only long enough to confirm my suspicion that they thereby avoid any discussion of the content of whatever they’re judging to be positive or negative.
>
>Haven’t been disappointed yet.

Thanks, Douglas Michael Massing.

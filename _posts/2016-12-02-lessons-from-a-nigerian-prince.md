<h4>What Marketers can Learn from the Error-riddled E-mails of Phishing Con-Artists</h4>
<p>Anyone reading this is probably familiar with spam and phishing email scams. The most well-known one is probably the “<a href="https://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/get-consumer-help/articles/the-nigerian-prince-old-scam-new-twist/" target="_blank">Nigerian Prince</a>” scam. You get an email from someone claiming to be a prince or government official of some kind in an African country — usually Nigeria.</p>
<p>They insist that some wealthy person has passed away and that you have been selected to help transfer the money out of the country. For that service, you’ll get a sizable fee. All the person needs is some of your private information: bank account number, social security number, etc. Or they need you to send some money upfront to cover fees, and they will transfer a decent sum of money to you.</p>
<p>It sounds to many like there’s no way that these scams could work, and yet they do. What’s more interesting is that, if you’ve ever received one of these emails in an English-speaking country, you have likely noticed that the emails prominently feature elementary spelling and grammar errors — not mere typos, but just plain poor writing in general.</p>
<h4>The Benefits of Looking Blatantly Shady</h4>
<p>It’s the kind of thing that most native speakers will see as a red flag, and cause them to immediately disregard the message. For a while, it made me wonder why they didn’t spend more time writing the emails in a way to make them look more professional — after all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Nigeria" target="_blank">the official language of Nigeria is English</a>. So it stands to reason that someone in government or a royal family — who would have received a decent education — would not make the kind of rudimentary spelling and grammar errors that these con-artists make. Why not make it more believable, and thus more likely to rope-in possible skeptics?</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: those “errors” — the terrible spelling and grammar — are actually <em>done on purpose</em>. And that is exactly the genius of them. The scammers aren’t interested in wide appeal. They want a large group of people to dismiss their emails, so that a small group of people — their targets — can get on board.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-nigerian-scam-emails-are-obvious-2014-5" target="_blank">Libby Kane writes in a piece on <em>Business Insider</em></a>, Microsoft computer scientist Cormac Herley did some interesting research on this. The egregious errors that seem to ruin the scammers’ credibility with most people are actually a key part of the profitability of the scam:</p>
<blockquote>…it’s in the scammers’ best interest to minimize the number of false positives who cost them effort but never send them cash. By sending an initial email that’s obvious in its shortcomings, the scammers are isolating the most gullible targets. If you trash their email, that’s fine. They don’t want <em>you</em>, someone from whom there’s virtually no chance of receiving any money. They want people who, faced with a ridiculous email, still don’t recognise its illegitimacy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As Herley tells the book’s authors, “Anybody who doesn’t fall off their chair laughing is exactly who they want to talk to.”</blockquote>
<p>Spam and phishing exercises purposely have spelling and grammar errors so that they don’t end up hooking fishes who aren’t particularly gullible. By doing that, they eliminate nearly all of the most wasteful work that they’d have to do trying to lure in people who would require the most coaxing.</p>
<p>They send a signal that clearly shows the people they <em>don’t </em>want to deal with “this is not for you — delete it.”</p>
<h4>What this Strategy Can Teach Legitimate People</h4>
<p>This strategy can be used in reverse for marketing or getting customers. Don’t use things that are cheap or deceptive or sensationalized in an effort to lure in as many prospective customers as possible. What will end up happening is that you get people who are interested in that sensational thing, but once they understand what you’re actually selling, they won’t stick around. You will have wasted your time energy and effort.</p>
<p>The real trick is to telegraph something about your product or service that makes it clear who your ideal client would be, but more importantly, who your ideal clients <em>wouldn’t </em>be. If you’re about to say <em>but, EVERYONE is my ideal client!</em> —that’s a big part of the problem.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t want everyone to become your customer. That is not sustainable, nor is it profitable. There will always be a group of people that will require more work to retain that is worth it. Save yourself the costs of on-boarding them and keeping them by preventing them from buying in the first place. The idea that these Nigerian prince scammers use — sending discouraging signals — is a great way to do that.</p>
<p>But what does this come down to when you’re not a scammer — when you’re selling a legitimate product or service? I think it might just be two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practicing honesty and transparency about what you’re selling, and more so, what you’re NOT selling.</li>
<li>Simplicity — a simple, non-wordy message about what your product and company are all about (and again, what you’re NOT about).</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing those two things is NOT easy. The words you use, the designs you use, and where those things are published are all part of proper conveyance of your message — and properly vetting potential customers. But I think that focusing on those two things can help you to be more efficient in reaching the kind of customers that will really want want you offer — rather than ones who continually demand something they <em>thought</em> they were getting, but that you never really offered.</p>

About 3 years ago to the day, I finally sat down and read David Allen's seminal work on productivity [*Getting Things Done*](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280). It would not in fact be hyperbole to say that it changed my outlook entirely. But the change took a while to really sink in. You see, I had been searching for a system for a while. I was always busy, but never completing the things that I wanted to complete. I was never short on ambitions, but I was always short on plans to realize any of them. Enter GTD.

Throughout the year after reading the book, I became obsessed---as I am wont to do---with productivity porn. I tried numerous task managers, reference file programs, folders, pens, notebooks, and so on. I put up the famous [GTD flowchart](http://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf) on my cubicle wall at work, assuming that the magic contained therein would sprinkle upon me as I diligently continued my totally reactive work routine. That, of course, did not happen.

Fast forward to the present date, 2016(ish), and I am finally starting to get it. I've abandoned all but 2 pieces of software for [managing projects](http://workflowy.com)and [storing information](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/). I'm done looking at programs that promise more productivity and organization. What I've realized is this: while a *system* for handling and organizing your goals, tasks, and information is important, the most important thing in getting things done is your *perception* of what needs doing.

Think of it this way: do you have things that you *have* to do, or things that you *get* to do? Really think about that question. Notice the way it's *not* worded. It's not asking if you have things you *want* to do. Nobody *wants* to call up customer service to dispute the weird charge on their credit card. Nobody wants to buy stamps to finally mail out that thank you note. The question is what you *get* to do, and the things you *get* to do are more positively framed than the things you *have* to do.

This is no hack, or trick, or gimmick. It will take work to begin to see your list of tasks and projects in this way. In fact, it will take you going through all of the open loops and relating everything back to your actual goals to effectively change your perception. However, once all of your open tasks are related to projects that are clearly part of reaching some goal you do really aspire to, everything on your list becomes something you *get* to do. Waking up in the morning to then check your open tasks becomes like a mini-Christmas morning. You unwrap the list and see all the things that—when done—will take you a step closer to getting you where you're aiming to go.

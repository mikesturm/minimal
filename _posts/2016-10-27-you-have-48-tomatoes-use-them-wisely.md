<h4>A Better Way to Value Your Time</h4>
<p>I suck at time management, but I’m slowly finding ways to get better. I’ve stumbled upon an idea — more like a collage of existing methods, that I think may just be a better way to manage time. I think it will work because it combines visual representation of time available, interval work, and simplistic prioritization. Take a look, and feel free to comment on the piece as you see fit.</p>
<h4>Tomatoes?</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> was invented by Francesco Cirillo. While in college, he began using a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato to keep him doing tasks for 25 straight minutes, with 5 minute breaks after each interval. That 25/5 interval is called a <em>pomodoro</em> — Italian for “tomato”.</p>
<p>This technique works, and I recommend it to anyone having trouble staying on tasks for more than a few minutes. But what I like about it goes way beyond the technique itself. I like the way that it views your time. If we really want to think about time like money — so we can better manage it, we must think about how we spend it. In order to do that, we need a basic unit in which to think of it. To me, nothing does this better than the 30 minute block — or tomato.</p>
<p>So, last time I checked, we have 24 hours each day. That’s 48 tomatoes — 48 half-hour intervals. That means that you start each day with 48 tomatoes to throw at the stuff in your life — projects, tasks, activities, service, etc. Keeping the mindset of how many tomatoes you’ve thrown and how many you have left seems to me like a hell of an easy way to get more serious about valuing your time.</p>
<h4>Start With Scarcity</h4>
<p>The tragedy is that most of us (hopefully all of us) start our days with 10 to 16 tomatoes already thrown. We sleep for 5 to 8 hours. So essentially you don’t really have 48 tomatoes to throw, you have more like 38 or 32.</p>
<p>So with 32 tomatoes to throw, you can now begin looking at the things on your to-do list, and size them up — not just in their importance and urgency, but also in their expense — as in <em>how much time will they cost you to do</em>? Counting your tomatoes makes this easy. If you have a task that will take you 2 hours to complete, that’s 4 tomatoes, 4 of 32 available, or 1/8 of your daily allowance. So is that task worth 1/8 of your tomatoes? It’s certainly a place to start thinking about time management.</p>
<h4>The Daily Budget, Deep Working, and Ivy Lee</h4>
<p>In <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">Deep Work</a>, Cal Newport suggests that we schedule every task we want to do in a day, and make every attempt to stick to that schedule — pushing away other distractions. The benefits of doing this can be tremendous, and it makes the best use of your time. So when you measure time in tomatoes, you want to squeeze the most work you can out of each one.</p>
<p>In order to do this, you will want to make a time budget.</p>
<p>One effective way to make a time budget that I’ve found is to combine the so-called “Ivy Lee Method” for important tasks. <a href="http://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee" target="_blank">It’s been laid out elsewhere</a>, so I won’t go into it here. But the gist is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on 6 tasks that you see as the most import and/or urgent for the next day.</li>
<li>Work those 6 tasks before and at the expense of all others.</li>
<li>Repeat 1&amp;2 daily.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve laid out these 6 items, you can go in and assign them a tomato value. On my master project/task list (for which still use <a href="http://workflowy.com" target="_blank">Workflowy</a> — thank you very much!), I place a 🍅 (tomato icon) for each half hour I estimate the task will take me. Thus begins an effective time budget for the day.</p>
<h4>Why This Just Might Work</h4>
<p>Visual indicators are effective. Warehouses and manufacturers use them for inventory and production management. Organizational methodology relies on them. Even financial budgeting software utilized visual indicators that take raw data and assign them color, size, or presence/absence change values to show we feeble-minded humans that stuff is changing.</p>
<p>So if you wake up at 6am, your initial bunch of tomatoes looks like this:</p>

</figure><p>Let’s say you have 3 meetings: 2 of them are an hour, one is a half hour. Take those off first:</p>

</figure><p>You have to commute to and from work, and you also have to pick up a few things from the grocery store. Toss a few more:</p>

</figure><p>Now, let’s say you’ve got to cook dinner, eat it, and clean up afterward. You’re also going to bed by 10pm, right?</p>

</figure><p>You’re going to eat lunch, right? And how about that time you use to randomly talk to people/catch up/follow-up/etc?</p>

</figure><p>The above tomatoes are what you’re left with to do your 6 tasks. And let’s be honest, if you actually care about them, you likely will need something like 25 minutes to devote to each one. So at minimum, that leaves you with this for the rest of the day’s stuff:</p>

</figure><p>See how quickly the time flies?</p>
<p>The Bottom Line? Time is valuable, and scarce. So the more you leverage visual management to treat it that way, the more likely you’ll be to value it. Just my thoughts. As always, I’m tinkering.</p>

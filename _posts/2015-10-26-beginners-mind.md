It is not news that nearly every company places a high premium on innovation. When companies innovate, they end up being able to (to put it simply) do more and do better. So it stands to reason that those people who can provide innovative ideas and get them moving toward implementation are highly valued. Fortunately, the more competitive the market gets, the more innovation is valued by companies; it's truly a skill for all seasons. But how does one become an innovator, how does one make up that great idea that can really turn everything upside down? Luckily, the answer kind of follows the form of a favorite internet trope of mine — the "one weird trick" proposal.

Here's the trick: *shoshin*

The word **shoshin** is used in Zen Buddhism to signify what [Shunryu Suzuki](http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-Shunryu-Suzuki/dp/1590308492) called *"Beginner's Mind"*. It's the phrase which is supposed to capture one's attitude toward something when they first encounter it. It also describes having a basically **empty** mind, meaning that there are no presuppositions, judgments, or things to cloud a fresh take on something. For those of you whose major in college was something that you enjoyed studying, think back to your first class in that subject — the first time you cracked open that book. It seemed like the possibilities were endless, and there was so much to explore. That's the feeling associated with *shoshin*. In your "beginner's mind" there is quite a bit that you don't know, but you really don't know *what* you don't know that is, you are ignorant to what you have yet to learn. Though that may *seem* like a disadvantage, it's really not. Here's the best relevant pull quote from the man himself:

>If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.
-Shunryu Suzuki-

What's great about the beginner's mind is not just that there are many possibilities, but also, there are basically no obstacles. I'll say that again; there are basically no obstacles. To translate this to more business friendly terms, if you want to truly innovate in the realm of some project, you have to adopt the beginner's mind in your approach to it. When yo do that, you abandon the obstacles you've stopped at before, and you can ask yourself if they were really ever in your way, because the way might be totally different than you thought. Here's a suggestion as to get in the beginner's mind mode.

First, target a problem or project that you really want to blow open and innovate. For any meetings you have about the project, drop the existing agenda, and set one objective that contains the verb "understand". An example of this would be "Understand what the customer is looking for in this software." The reason why "understand" works so well as the meat of an objective is because it forces you to adopt the beginner's mind, empty of all the answers that you *think* you have. From there, you can ask questions, a*lot of questions*, and listen (*really listen*) to what you get in response.

The culmination of this process should be a *new* understanding of the problem you were trying to solve. This shouldn't be something you actively crafted, rather it should find its way into your mind (which is conveniently open and empty). Though this sounds like a passive process, and like any old person off the street could do it, it is not. Give it a whirl in your next meeting. Go into a meeting about a subject that you know a great deal about, and try to just listen, and understand the concerns and problems of others, without drawing from your own assumptions or judgments. It is profoundly difficult to keep the "standard noise" out of your mind. So there is nothing passive about obtaining an empty mind; it's hard work, and few ever really master it.

Nearly every day, I find myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information to which I, as a humble non-tech-sector layperson, have access. The internet, for all the faults that it may bring out or reveal in us humans,  never ceases to  impresses me with its ability to provide large amounts of fertilizer for knowledge.

The problem with fertilizer, though, is that bullshit happens to be a great fertilizer. As anyone with a connection to it can attest, the internet is rife with just that particular type of fertilizer.

The internet's ability to fertilize the fields of our minds can go to waste if we don't go about cultivating it in the right way. What follows is a way of thinking about processing information that I've come to find useful. It is a model that I have begun to use for *doing* something with all the information that I come across out there in cyberspace.

## Bite

Attach your attention to the information. This can be anything from saving an article to your "read/review" stack, or just getting it in a psychic space that marks it as something you're going to *really* look at. Don't gum up the works with a heap of stuff you wouldn't look at twice on a stack of paper publications.

I keep a "read/review" list in my huge [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) document, with links to stuff I plan to actually look over. I try to save only things that I know I will spend more than 3 minutes reading and doing something with. There's a famous rule that governs behavior like that---stick to it.

## Chew

Take and process the information that you have "bitten" off. This process should take you longer than you think it should. Remember when you've heard---from time to time, and from various outlets---that chewing your food for longer is better for you (on *numerous* levels)? Well the same holds true for processing the information. Really swirl it around your mind for a while, just as you'd let a really good piece of food move around your mouth to hit all the sensory parts of your tongue, so should you let all of the parts of your mind touch the information you're now processing. You'll be glad you did.

## Swallow

This is the part that should take the least amount of time, but *only* if you have a  mature and effective organizational system. Think about it this way. When you're swallowing food, you're starting the process of having your body *use* the food you've just processed---you're now making that food useful. When processing information---learning---it should be no different. You're now passing along that information to that part of your mind that will store it as *knowledge* for you to use. Swallowing the information you're learning involves two main things:

**Verifying** that you really do know it  
:   The best way to do this is by testing yourself, which I've found is most effectively done by having to teach or present it to someone else that doesn't know about the subject at all. I taught philosophy at the community college level for over 4 years, and I learned more about philosophy doing that, than I estimate I learned in my entire time in graduate school.

:   It's well known that having to teach others something forces you to get a better grip on things. You may think you know something inside out, but when you have to explain it to others, you realized that you don't. This is especially true when you have to teach things to people who don't know much (or anything) about your subject. A favorite quote of mine, attributed to Albert Einstein, captures this truth perfectly: **"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."**


**Organizing** the information  
:   This part involves making the information readily accessible, and ready for updates, emendations, further analysis, and other reviews. It is also a way to ensure that this chunk of new knowledge finds its way into the web of your current knowledge as a *connected piece*. If you can't connect what you're now learning to what you already know, the chances of you really grabbing a hold of it go down dramatically.

Once you've bitten, chewed, and swallowed your information diet, chances are, you are more likely to have increased your knowledge base. I've found it helpful to remind myself of this process as I try to gain more knowledge. It is, after all, power.

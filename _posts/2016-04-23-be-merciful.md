I grew up Going to Catholic school, despite the fact that my parents were not very religious. I did the altar boy thing, I went to confession, I learned the rosary prayers---the whole shootin' match. Then, in high school, I got heavy into philosophy, and it was all over. I abandoned the metaphysically troublesome belief in a personal god, and went down a path motivated primarily by logic and reason.

One thing from my Catholic days, however, stuck with me: mercy. Mercy in the face of repeated wrongdoing. Mercy in the face of ignorance and arrogance. Mercy again and again. For my money---to steal a phrase from Jesus---there were never enough other cheeks to turn.

As I adopted a more nuanced spiritual stance, that attitude stuck with me. I always retained the belief that people deserve mercy, which means forgiveness and second (and third, and fourth) chances.

Why do I believe this? Is it because I read it in the Bible at a young age? No. I've shed plenty of beliefs that were foisted upon me as a child. Is it because I found an intricate and airtight argument in favor of it? Not quite. No, I believe in mercy because I find that everyone is chasing after something a little bit different, and has a different path in mind for how to get it.

## Give People a Chance

None of us knows it all---or even *most* of it, for that matter. We are just giving it our best shot, and we all fall short---time and time again. It's just that we all fall short in different ways. We all started with different advantages and flaws. Some of those flaws are more accepted by society than others, and we pay different prices because of that.

But I'm not here just to go on a diatribe about doing the right thing for it's own sake; as noble as that would be. Rather, I'm here to suggest that in this case, being merciful---giving others a chance---is going to help you out too, time and time again. So give others a chance, and watch what happens.



## A chance to speak

Give others a chance to speak, before you do. Yes, your voice is important, but you would be amazed at how much people will come to respect your voice if you don't use it at every single opportunity. Instead, practice some restraint, and allow others to speak---to voice their beliefs, concerns, and interests. At the very least, this will allow you the opportunity to gain valuable insight into your environment, and to develop strategies and plans based on it. That is important.



## A Chance for Your Friends to Prove Themselves

We all, by and large, wish to be understood---especially by friends and those close to us. Any good leader knows this, and you don't have to have the official position of a leader to actually lead people; you can do that from below. In fact, sometimes, that's the most effective way to do it, because you're basically just letting good people do great things.



## A Chance for Your Foes to Prove Themselves Wrong

When dealing with those who we are up against---whether in business or in personal contexts---we often feel the need to win battles by winning an argument. Often times, we will express this need by launching into monologues or arguments, where we assert our position. But you would be surprised by how often you can win by simply letting the other side defeat themselves. Let the other side talk. Allow uncomfortable silences---which they will often impatiently fill with more speaking.

More speaking means more opportunities to contradict oneself, which provides a near-effortless victory for you. It is like allowing an opponent to swing around their too-heavy sword until they eventually hit themselves with it or become exhausted. You end up winning without having to even draw your weapon.

## A Chance for Better Understanding

Giving others the chance to speak also provides you with something valuable: better understanding. If you allow others to speak, and you really attempt to listen, you can gain a better understanding of both that person and your broader environment. Even if they blatantly lie to you, that tells you something about your relationship with that person. That is valuable information.



## A Chance to Do the Right Thing...or the Wrong Thing

Too often, we try to do everything ourselves, rather than enlisting help because we are confident that we can get things done, and get them done better. But we do this at the cost not of allowing others to show us their potential. If we never allow others to do the right thing, and do well, we lose an opportunity to get valuable help and gain valuable allies. And why? Because we fear inconvenience? Because we fear having to do a little extra work?

As a culture, we applaud risk-taking, and rightly so. No risk, no reward, right? But this applause seems reserved only for taking risks by doing more yourself. But what about taking a risk by letting others help you? There's still risk there. Others could fail to meet expectations, cheat you, sabotage you. That's real risk---just like the risk you face if you try to do something yourself. The reward, however, is *much* better than the reward of going at it alone. You end up with a new ally. You have effectively doubled your power to accomplish things.

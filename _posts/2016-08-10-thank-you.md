<p>Greetings, creators! I know that it has been a while since you’ve received a letter from us. I can’t promise that the frequency of the letters will change (though, would you <em>want</em> such a promise? You probably receive enough emails as it is).</p>
<p>That aside, I just wanted to reach out and — on behalf of the editorial team at <em>The Creator’s Path</em> (basically <a href="https://medium.com/u/3a8eb8927981" target="_blank">David King</a> and myself — say <strong>thank you</strong>.</p>
<p>Thank you all for helping to make this publication one of the top 100 publications on Medium. David tweeted about it a few days ago, when we were #98. Now we’re down to #103. So this “thank you” comes with a caveat — we need you to help us get back up in the top 100.</p>
<p>I am here at <em>The Creator’s Path</em> because I believe in what it is about. I want to keep it around for a while — keep it relevant — and I hope you do too.</p>
<p>So, if you know someone who would appreciate what we do here, ask them to follow us. Shoot them a link to one of your favorite pieces on the publication. If you aren’t already a writer for <em>The Creator’s Path</em>, email a link to your best piece that fits our model, and if it looks good, we’ll welcome you aboard.</p>
<p>Godspeed,</p>

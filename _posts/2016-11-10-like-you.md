<h4>A Short Apropos Poem</h4>
<p>The only way that I can keep going on</p>
<p>is to remember that like you, I love.</p>
<p>Like you, I thirst</p>
<p>I hunger</p>
<p>I yearn</p>
<p>I hurt</p>
<p>I do all of these things — nay — they happen to me</p>
<p>as they happen to you.</p>
<p>My heart treads a different path, but beats just as hard</p>
<p>as yours.</p>
<p>The blood is as dark and red</p>
<p>as yours.</p>
<p>My convictions push me as hard</p>
<p>as yours.</p>
<p>We are so alike, and yet we are so in denial</p>
<p>of that fact.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting, but I’m trying to remember</p>
<p>to channel the faith in my cause</p>
<p>into faith in <em>us</em>, that you and I</p>
<p>can be an <em>us</em> again.</p>
<p>That <em>we</em> are like <em>me</em></p>
<p>and like you.</p>
<p>Like you, I forget this from time to time.</p>
<p>But that is okay, because you do, too.</p>
<p>We can forgive — people like me,</p>
<p>like you.</p>

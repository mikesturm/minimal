*This is part 3 of a 3 part series on better communication through the 3:1 rule. For the full rundown of this rule, see [Part 1]({% post_url 2015-06-15-3-1-rule-part-1 %})*

## Adjust Your Sentence Ratio

Without getting into too much linguistics, sentences tend to fall under 4 categories: declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, and imperative.

In a given day, most people will not use the last two types of sentences. Exclamatory sentences are ones where one is merely expressing emotion, like “yay!”, “woo-hoo!”, “f*$&!”, or “Go Cubs!”. Imperatives are used a bit more often, but pretty much preclude conversation by their very nature. They demand that someone do something (or cease doing it, depending on the words in the sentence). Parents are likely using many of these every day to speak to their children. Examples include “get down!” or “stop doing that!”.

My focus here is on the first two types of sentences: declarative and interrogative. The former is any sentence in which one is stating a fact or an opinion. The latter is any sentence which is asking a question. For most people, regardless of language, the ratio of declarative to interrogatives is pretty high.

*We make a lot of statements, and ask precious few questions.*

This ratio gets even more lopsided when we are doing our jobs, and the longer we’ve been doing our jobs, the more lopsided it gets. This is unfortunate, for a reason that I brought up in my [earlier post]({% post_url 2015-06-15-3-1-rule-part-1 %}): you tend to learn the most when you are asking questions, rather than making statements.

The second part of the 3:1 rule focuses on re-balancing your ratio of interrogative to declarative statements, and it is dead simple.

*Ask 3 questions for every 1 statement you make.*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In terms of a little clarification, try to make the questions open-ended (i.e., not answerable by “yes” or “no”), and try to make them the kind with answers you *don’t* already know. The purpose behind this part of the 3:1 rule is, like the first part, to get you in the mindset to learn more things. That means that when you do ask your 3 questions, work on really listening to the answers you get. The beautiful part of listening is that often times, you will need a little clarification in order to better understand what the answer you got actually means. Therefore, you will have no short supply of other questions to ask.

Asking more questions in this way can do a few things. First, you’ll be getting to know more about those you work with or live with, and will also help them to warm up to you more (so long as they sense that you’re listening). People tend to feel better about those who seem interested in them, and there is no better way to show interest than to ask more questions.

Secondly, you might just find yourself realizing just how much you don’t know, as you receive answers that contradict your current opinions. When I first began to ask questions in this way, I was amazed at how much a house of cards my current structure of supposed “knowledge” was.

> We carry around so many assumptions with us on a daily basis---ones that are flat out contradicted by the facts. What is worse, we quite often act on them.

Finally, in racking your brain to come up with more questions, you will likely find yourself asking better questions---the kind that get people thinking; the kind that can open your and others’ minds to more creative solutions to difficult problems. In short, asking more and better questions can help you and others come up with more and better possible answers---or at least reveal to you no shortage of possible avenues to explore.

### A Caveat, of Course

Every good rule has an exception or two, and this rule is no exception to that rule (that made sense, right?). So here’s a 2-part caveat to the 2 part rule. It’s meant to be a rough approximation, and it’s not meant for every situation. You don’t need to walk around the office (or your home) with a clicker, counting out the questions you asked and the statements you made. You also don’t need to refuse to answer others’ questions with a statement because your ratio is in danger. Don’t be that guy (or girl). This, like so many other “rules” of business and of life, is a mere guidepost, meant to point your efforts in the right direction. But I have to say that questions are such a powerful tool, and they are _so_ easy to use, it’s a shame that we do not use them more often. Just injecting more of them into your daily routine can make a huge difference.

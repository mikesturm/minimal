<h3>When You Think About It</h3>
<h4>A Poem</h4>
<p>When we leave this all</p>
<p>remember why we were there,</p>
<p>for all</p>
<p>of those who care</p>
<p>it might be a blessing,</p>
<p>though vainly disguised.</p>
<p>But when we get out, we may find something</p>
<p>to gain</p>
<p>something to lose,</p>
<p>either way it’s the same.</p>
<p>Because when you think about it,</p>
<p>there is much more for the white</p>
<p>and less for the blues</p>
<p>as if anything said through clenched teeth</p>
<p>could ever be good news.</p>
<p>So not for monotony,</p>
<p>but I think I may have had a damn good time.</p>
<p>And the dichotomy is sharply seen</p>
<p>at this point of the line,</p>
<p>where the credits are rolling over.</p>
<p>So for those traveling far</p>
<p>remember the faces that you are</p>
<p>and crack a smile</p>
<p>lest someone crack it for you.</p>
<p>Do please let the feelings go</p>
<p>and make sure they never know</p>
<p>where you hid your gold.</p>
<p>Until then</p>
<p>time and again</p>
<p>keep what is fleeting</p>
<p>because permanent things hurt</p>
<p>the most.</p>
<p>-<em>a toast</em>-</p>

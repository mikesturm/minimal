<h2>Run…for Your Life</h2>










<h3>Run…for Your Life.</h3>
<blockquote>It’s easier to get moving when you’ve already gotten moving.</blockquote>
<p>Today is <a href="http://www.runningday.org/" target="_blank">National Running Day</a> in the U.S., and I feel that I would be remiss if I didn’t wax a little philosophical about the subject. So, without further ado, I present my thoughts on what could be the world’s simplest sport.</p>
<p><strong>Running demands a focus on what matters</strong></p>
<p>There have been very few times where I have gone out running and spent the rest of the day feeling mentally clouded and overwhelmed. Quite simply, running (if you do it right) forces you to focus on making it through the run. Yes, you will have other thoughts, and they may distract you for a little while, but when you begin to hit a physically demanding pace, you quickly dump extraneous thoughts and preoccupations like so much extra cargo on a fuel-depleted plane.</p>
<p><strong>Running demands that you dig deep</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most Malcolm Gladwell-ish thing I’ll write today, but the one trait that seems to display the most return on investment in helping people “make it” is perseverance. In fact, <em>This American Life </em>did <a href="http://iserotope.com/this-american-life-474-back-to-school/" target="_blank">a whole story about it <em>vis-à-vis </em>education.</a> There is no more primal a challenge to place yourself in front of than forcing your way through a tough run. This applies whether you’re running 10-miles at a 7:00/mile pace, or just trying to run for 30 seconds straight on your first time out. If you are <em>really </em>challenging yourself, it hurts all the same; it weighs down on you just as heavily; you have to dig just as deep to find the fight to push through and keep going. When you do push through, it is glorious, it is validating, it is cathartic. You will recognize a very similar feeling when you go hard at a project, or bear down during a brainstorming session and stumble upon a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>Running can bring you peace</strong></p>
<p>This may sound counter-intuitive, but bear with me. If you normally find yourself stressed, filled with anxiety, and feel depleted by the day’s end, hoping for a surprise coma to keep you from having to deal with the pile of sh — -stuff on your desk tomorrow, try running. Run hard. Run to beat your last record. You will feel exhausted. You will have left it all on the road (or the trail) so to speak. But somehow, after a shower and your coffee, you’ll feel like everything is a lot less loud and fear-inducing. I don’t expect you to take my word for it; go ahead and try it. Feel free to email me in all caps to digitally yell at me if you don’t feel the aforementioned effects.</p>
<p><strong>Running sets a productive tone</strong></p>
<p>If you wake up while most of the world is still asleep, and get a solid effort in during a run (no matter what your pace or mileage), I defy you to not feel the wind of productivity at your back. Running creates momentum, both physical <em>and</em> emotional momentum. The latter is so vital to being productive, because momentum is 80% of the battle in whatever you’re trying to get done. It’s easier to get moving when you’ve already gotten moving.</p>
<p><strong>Running is Simple, but incredibly difficult and humbling</strong></p>
<p>There is no simpler sport than running, and yet it is one of the most difficult to do well. Anyone can run with no equipment required (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189" target="_blank">some have taken this to the extreme, forgoing even shoes</a>). There are no barriers to entry, no tools that need to be purchased and learned before one can even begin the process. There are no books to read, no certifications to earn, no mentors that need be sought out. You can (and should) just get the hell out there and run! Once you are out there, the simplicity of the exercise gives way to the difficulty of pushing yourself past previous limits. The end point is so far away as you begin to fatigue, and yet all you can do is keep taking one step at a time. You can speed up or slow down, but either will cost you over time; you must be strategic in using your energy. There is a hidden economy at work in a run.</p>
<p>Running is often the subject of metaphors that are used when talking about perseverance, achievement, and strength. Think of it: “mad dash”, “hit the ground running”, “crossing the finish line”, and so on. If you’ve ever really pushed yourself on a run, you will know exactly why that is. Each run can be a saga, a war; rising action, climax, denouement. Every set of emotions, and nearly every type of gut-wrenching adversity can be experienced during a good run. It can only help you to go out there and run after them — literally.</p>

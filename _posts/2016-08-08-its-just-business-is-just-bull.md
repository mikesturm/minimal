<h3>“It’s Just Business” is Just Bull</h3>
<h4>The most damaging lie we tell ourselves.</h4>

</figure><p>There is a saying that I hear quite often — usually by older folks — and it bugs the hell out of me: “it is what it is”.</p>
<p>From what I can glean, it basically means “I’m done thinking and/or talking about whatever we’re talking about.” The implication is that the other party in the conversation is complaining too much, and that it’s not going to do any good to talk more about whatever it is. For the most part, I take it as a sign of intellectual laziness — which is appropriate because it’s a tautology, the laziest of logical sentences.</p>
<p>Here’s my problem with it, aside from the way it is used (as a dismissive conversation ender): <em>most of the time, it’s simply not true</em>. That’s right, things are <em>almost never </em>just what they are. Everything is always something else as well. The lunch you pack for your child is not just a lunch. The hug you give to your spouse before they leave on a long trip is not just a hug. Every gesture, every sentence, every movement is more than just “what it is”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example of this is my all-time favorite lie:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not personal, it’s just business.”</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that you were neck deep in a business deal that was particularly contentious, one-sided, and laced with disrespect. You feel like you got pounded, like your value went unnoticed. You vent to someone about it, and they — in their infinite wisdom tell you: “well, it’s just business, not personal”. How utterly useless is that?</p>
<p>Business is <em>very</em> personal. For most people, the time they spend doing business is the <em>vast majority</em> of their waking hours each week. They wake up early, they stay late. They sacrifice time with their families and friends. They pour their heart and soul into the work they do. They take pride in the progress they make, and they have valuable relationships with their coworkers and business colleagues. It doesn’t get much more personal than that.</p>
<p>Need evidence? Look at how popular the tags of business, productivity, and work are on <a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6" target="_blank">Medium</a> and elsewhere. Would there be so many views of these tags if people didn’t care about doing good work? I doubt it.</p>
<p>People want to do a job they can be proud of, and when a customer or vendor takes a steaming dump all over that job during a deal, it is <em>far </em>from “not personal”. It is almost <em>always</em> personal — even if the decision isn’t made for explicitly personal reasons, it is personal to someone. Douchebags who <em>really</em> believe that business isn’t personal are the exact douchebags who will end up taking steaming, disrespectful dumps on the hard work of others. They may not be committing douchebaggery on purpose — just committing douchebaggery by failing to consider that their conduct is affecting real people who poured a lot of time and effort into something.</p>
<p>Business is what provides livelihoods — both to persons, and to societies. The way a people does business is a reflection of its character. So no, it is not “just business” — it is always more than that. If exploitation, deceit, and one-sided deals are the norm, that sends a strong message about the people doing them — a terrible one.</p>
<p>Don’t get it twisted, though. I am not saying that in business we should strive to make everyone feel good all of the time. That’s not possible. What I <em>am</em> saying is that we can’t just adopt a different code of conduct in business than what we ought to use in our personal lives. One is just an extension of the other. As long as business is done between people, those doing business must treat it as such. It is personal, so act accordingly.</p>

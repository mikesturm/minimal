<h3>Happy Labor Day</h3>
<h4>If you’re in America</h4>
<p>Today was Labor Day — and many of you probably won’t be reading this until it’s no longer Labor day. That’s okay with me, because I just wanted to reach out and say something tangentially related to the holiday, but that is hopefully evergreen.</p>
<p>Don’t work too hard. Seriously. And I think each one of you — if you’re honest with yourself — knows what “too hard” means. Your time and attention are like money, in that you need to have some left over for things you didn’t anticipate. Except, you <em>can’t</em> make more time and attention; you have what you have, and that’s it.</p>
<p>I’m not telling you this because I follow the advice, and I can show you how to do it (with my free e-book, and courses that are just $29 each!). I’m telling you this because I work too much. I work at a jobby-job, and write an egregious amount here on <a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6" target="_blank">Medium</a>. I leave really no time and attention for anything else. So everything that wasn’t scheduled or anticipated trips me up, freaks me out.</p>
<p>Whatever you think about labor unions, their original purpose was to make sure that our lives did not just disappear into work. The least we can do is just <em>think </em>about that.</p>
<p>That’s all I’ve got.</p>
<p>Godspeed.</p>

<h4>Simple? Yes. Easy? No. But they will vastly improve how you feel and how well you do in life.</h4>
<p>About a year ago, I was traveling with the president of the company I work for. We had met with some high-level personnel at a large customer to finish negotiating a large contract. The day wrapped up, and we found ourselves in a corner booth at a fairly nice restaurant. The server brought us our drinks, and we toasted the closing of the deal. I decided to take the opportunity to extract some sage advice from someone that, to me, seemed to have it all together. So I asked him, point blank:</p>
<p>“What do you think is the key to success?”</p>
<p>He paused and looked down at his glass of wine, allowing a faint, but unmistakable grin to dance across his face. Then he looked up at me, and in the most sincere and assured manner in which I’ve ever seen anyone say anything, he said the following:</p>
<blockquote>“I believe that you really only have to do 2 things in life to be successful:</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Honor every commitment you make — big or small.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Keep your commitments to a minimum.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Be absolutely obsessive about those two things, and all else will follow.”</blockquote>
<p>This seemed too simple to me. But the more I wade through this life — with obligations to my company, my family, and my friends, the more I tend to agree with it.</p>
<p>Doing well really does boil down to these two things. Following them is <em>simple</em>, but not at all <em>easy</em>. The urge to do #1 can get confused with the urge to say “yes” to a bunch of things — meaning you abandon #2.</p>
<p>You may feel the urge to make people happy, or to help them out, and you should — it is good to help others. However, if you can’t keep the commitment, or if you have to break another commitment in order to keep another, then you’re not really helping much at all.</p>
<h3>Honor Every Commitment</h3>
<p>Honor every commitment you make — big or small. This does two things to make you a more responsible and effective person. First, it builds credibility and trust — as a colleague, a friend, a spouse, and whatever else your roles may be. Secondly, it alleviates a lot of emotional and cognitive dissonance, both within yourself, and within your relationships.</p>
<p>Stephen Covey, in his classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519" target="_blank"><em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a> uses the metaphor of an emotional bank account that is shared by you and anyone you interact with regularly. When you honor a commitment, you make a deposit in that account. When you break a commitment — no matter how small — you make a withdrawal from that account. I have found that often times, the withdrawals from breaking commitments — regardless of how small the commitment seems — are quite large. Unfortunately, the deposits made by keeping subsequent commitments are much smaller in comparison to the withdrawals.</p>
<p>Keeping commitments, big and small, goes beyond commitments to other people. Plenty of people sacrifice their time, resources, and ambitions for the sake of others. This is good, but it can become harmful when you keep those commitments at the cost of another important kind of commitment: <strong>the commitments you make to yourself.</strong></p>
<p>When you tell yourself you’re going to do something, but then push it aside in favor of other things, you damage your trust in yourself. Yes, you read that correctly; you do have a relationship of trust <em>with yourself</em>.</p>
<p>Effective people are effective in large part because they trust that what they set out to do will get done. They believe <em>in</em> themselves because they believe themselves. But when you procrastinate — when you keep failing to do what you told yourself you would do — that trust dissolves. It makes it that much more difficult to motivate yourself to meet deadlines you set for yourself when you haven’t been doing it so far. You intuitively sense that you cannot trust yourself, based on your track record of broken commitments.</p>
<h3>Keep Your Commitments to a Minimum</h3>
<p>Breaking commitments causes damage to relationships and reputations. Knowing that you will have to break a commitment causes anxiety about that inevitable damage — for both you and the other party. So the best way to prevent that anxiety and damage is to spend time on number 2: minimizing commitments.</p>
<p>The thing is, the work of keeping commitments takes time — <em>often more time than we initially think</em>. It also takes up attention, again, often more than we initially think. Both of those things — time and attention — are finite resources. We should <em>never</em> give them up freely to just anyone who demands them.</p>
<blockquote>Remember: unlike money, you cannot earn more time or attention, so guard them more carefully than your money.</blockquote>
<p>This is not to say that you should try to do the fewest things possible, be a flake, and be lazy. In fact, quite the contrary. When you commit to some outcome, you should do all that you can to ensure you bring it about. You should strive to go above and beyond what you promised. Surprise, dazzle, delight others with what you do. But doing so is only possible <em>if you carefully guard your commitments</em>. Having fewer commitments means you have more time and attention to devote to the things you have chosen to do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this second principle is about maximizing through minimizing — maximizing the <em>value</em> of your commitments comes as a result of minimizing the <em>quantity</em> of them. This makes perfect sense if you think about it.</p>
<p>Usually, taking on a lot of projects means being tasked with unchallenging and non-value-add work in some portion of them. If you get really serious about keeping every commitment, your natural tendency will be to seek out commitments to things with a high ROI (where the “I” is the investment of your time and mental energy).</p>
<p>Moreover, minimizing your commitments also does another thing to help add to the value you bring to yourself and others: it makes you more agile. Agility is your ability to spontaneously help someone with something — even without being asked. Aside from this being just a great thing to do from the standpoint of being a good person, it also helps you by solidifying your relationships with those around you. As if that weren’t enough, being agile allows you to explore new and interesting opportunities.</p>
<p>One simple way to think about it is this:</p>
<blockquote>Essentially, you are your commitments, so just how many things are you trying to be?</blockquote>
<h3>The Action Item</h3>
<p>Now for the takeaway: keep a commitment ledger. It is a record of what you have committed to, when you’ve committed to doing it, and to whom you’ve committed.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you probably have a “ to do” list — you know, a list of things that itemize just how busy and stretched thin you are. But how many of those “to dos” represent actual commitments? How many do you think you’ll be able to keep?</p>
<p>You may not even know: and that is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Keeping a commitment ledger is simple. If you have a to-do list or a project register, this ledger can be embedded there. Any time you tell someone that you are going to do something, tag it with something that lets you know that you’ve committed to it. If a date was promised, write that in with it.</p>
<p>An even <em>more</em> reliable approach would be for any commitment with a date attached, put that on your calendar as an “all-day” event. I use both Microsoft Outlook and the iCloud calendar. As an added jab to yourself, being each entry on the ledger with (in all caps) “PROMISED:”. It works like a charm. This way when you look at your stuff on tap for the day, the very top of the calendar day will say “PROMISED: email report to Jeff” — or whatever. It’s tough to ignore that. This practice also helps to separate the true commitments I have from other stuff that just needs to be done <em>at some time.</em></p>
<p>Wherever you put them, look at those commitments every day — first thing, if possible — and direct most of your energy toward them. Direct any remaining energy and attention toward making sure you don’t take on any more commitments than you can handle. This is difficult, but doable — if done in the right way.</p>
<p>For any commitments you know you can’t meet, re-negotiate them as soon as possible, and be gracious about it with the person. After all, you made them a promise, so make sure they understand that you are doing this as soon as you could have. The amount of respect that this will earn you (in <em>most</em> cases) is valuable enough to pay for any extra time you spend managing your commitment ledger.</p>
<p>In the end, we are only as good a person as the commitments we keep. So if you want to be the best person you can, guard your commitments like you guard priceless heirlooms. They are among the most valuable things on which you can spend your time and attention.</p>

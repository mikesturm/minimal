*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets them. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

It's the second week of my year-long analysis of the oblique strategies. Last week's strategy dealt with the idea of change, or rather the benefit of *not* changing, as it were. This week, my random pick from the deck provided an even more abstract notion---which I hardly thought to be possible. Speaking of possibility, here's this week's strategy:

>"It is quite possible (after all)"

Most immediately, this is about silencing your inner critic. But more than that, it's about what might be a hidden purpose of creative work. Could it be that creative work is *really* about proving that something is possible, after all? Think about the most notable creative works that you've encountered. How many of them *don't* in some way work against the received "wisdom" about what was possible, or what was commonplace? How many of those works don't swim (in some way) against the current, or forge a heretofore untrodden path (to further mix my metaphors)? I submit that nearly all of the notable works in the densely woven tapestry of human creative history have done just that.


## Momentum Is Key

Creative work is difficult. The concept of the *Oblique Strategies*---and thus this very series---is predicated on that fact. One of the most difficult aspects of creative work is gaining, and then maintaining momentum. Often times, we place hurdles in front of ourselves at the very beginning of the journey, as we start to work on a project. We tend to do this---either consciously or subconsciously---by getting critical much too early. We begin assessing whether or not our desired outcome is even possible, when we've barely even become aware of what it is we're trying to do. Think about what this *does* to us, psychologically. It places roadblocks in front of us; it impedes---nay, *prevents* momentum. It is like placing a hurdle 2 feet in front of the starting line of a race. Only a lucky few would be able to surmount such an obstacle with no time to get into a stride. When we concern ourselves with possibility as we try to do creative work, we begin dropping hurdles in front of ourselves far too soon.

Why can't you just *get started* and get something---anything---down on paper? After you do that, and start your mad creative dash, *then* you can stop, take a breath and assess whether what you've been pursuing looks like it can actually be done. You may be surprised as you find yourself zig-zagging and changing direction as you work. Creative momentum is a powerful thing, and it is well within the realm of possibility to begin with one result in mind, but shortly after that, find yourself on an entirely different path---and moving swiftly at that! Yet, in all that momentum, you likely will not have stopped to ask yourself "is this thing I'm doing possible?"

In many ways, creative work is about answering that question in the affirmative. It is about being uncertain---perhaps doubtful---as to whether or not *x* is even possible, and yet *because* of that (rather than in spite of it), you press on---press forward---toward *x*.

So consider this question: What if the unstated goal of your work becomes this: show that it is quite possible, after all?



## Impossibilities Abound

Perhaps the best example of this approach to abandoning possibility comes by way of the Cubism movement in visual art. What an ambitious goal it was, to portray all of the perspectives of objects, people, and scenes simultaneously to the viewer---to stand outside of the boundaries of time and space, and conveying that transcendence *visually*.

The impossibilities abounded! And yet, the likes of Duchamp, Braque, Picasso, and their cohorts did just that. Even if you, dear reader, are of the camp that believes they did no such thing, did they not at least show that it is (after all) possible? Didn't they shed the necessary doubt on the impossibility that previously seemed so damned certain? Perhaps the product did not look the way that you *expected* their proposed portrayal to look, but is that their problem, or yours?

The takeaway? Put aside your expectations of what you *think*  a thing should look like. It (after all) will only get in the way of actually creating something---or at least some *part* of something. You can (after all) revise the meaning of the terms of your expectations---and of your purpose---to fit  what you did end up creating. Just say to yourself "this thing *is* [adjective x] and though it doesn't appear that way, here's why it actually is [adjective x] after all." Now *that's* creativity. Even if the creation is not conventionally creative, your interpretation will be. And that kind of post-creation creativity can then further make those who *consume* the work that much more creative by challenging them to adopt an unconventional interpretive standpoint. It can be literally transformative.

Godspeed.

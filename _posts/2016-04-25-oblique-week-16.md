*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets it. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it's also the best way to get good at something.

When I was in art school, we had a project in my foundations painting class in which we were tasked to copy a masterwork. I chose to copy James Ensor's [*Masks Confronting Death*](http://www.moma.org/collection/works/79855?locale=en). This is a common practice in art education---hone your technique by imitating the greats. It works because it takes your mind out of the taxing and turbulent creative ideation zone and solidifies your mechanics. More than that, it works because when you're done, you realize *hey, I can make something great; I have the skill*. Once you have that confidence, you can go on to the fun stuff: ideation. Because whatever idea you come up with, you now know that you have the mechanics to give it life.


## Begin with Idolatry, End With iconoclasm

Almost all of us begin that way, with a certain kind of idolatry. We have heroes, artists and creatives who we emulate and imitate---to varying extents. We hold them in high regard, and in doing so, we end up holding ourselves in low regard. We tell ourselves---often unknowingly---that we can't do what those greats do. So this practice of imitation can help us work through that idolatry. You sit down and make something great that has already been made. You solidify your mechanics. You prove yourself to yourself. You literally answer---*for yourself*---the question of how your idol did that great thing.

With that out of the way, you can now walk amongst the giants of your field with the confidence of essentially being one of them. You can look at the work of the greats, and rather than asking how they did it, you can ask:

>how would YOU have done it?

<!--more-->

Now you've begun the stage of iconoclasm---taking apart the greats. Killing your idols.

There is a favorite quote of mine about this subject from Zen mythology, attributed to master Linji:

>[If you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha; if you meet the patriarchs, kill the patriarchs; if you meet an Arhat, kill the Arhat; if you meet your parents, kill your parents… in this way, you attain liberation. ](http://www.dailybuddhism.com/archives/670)

Obviously, this quote is hyperbolic, but the point is meant to be strong. There is no room for idols in creative work. Sure, proper reverence of great works and their creators is admirable---but only for a time. The true job of a creative---to paraphrase from [a wonderful speech by John Waters](https://youtu.be/Hl05XGifKb4) ---is to wreck what came before. That means there is no room for looking on agape at great work and worshiping those who created it. We as creators can only waste so much time on that kind of idolatry. We need to quickly move on to the iconoclasm. We need kill the buddhas. That is our real work.

But when you ask yourself how *you* would have done it, keep in mind that you're not asking yourself how you would have done that exact work. That's too limited a scope. Asking the question that way makes you nothing more than a cover artist or an art restorer. Rather, you're asking yourself how you would convey that idea, that emotion. If you're not a master of texture like Chuck Close, or as great a guitarist as Eric Clapton, fine. Then your answer to the question will involve how you would use a different approach---how you'd play different notes or make different brushstrokes. Hell, you may not even use a brush at all. Technique is a part of making great things, yes, but technique is not a monolithic term.

 Each artist has their own technique, and it's only a means to an end. Thomas Kincaid is a great technician. [Proofread Bot](http://proofreadbot.com/) is a great technician. But neither are setting the world on fire with their firm grasp of technique. Remember: Jimi Hendrix [couldn't even read music](http://ppcorn.com/us/2016/01/08/top-5-musicians-who-couldnt-read-music/). That doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in honing your technique, but it *does* mean you shouldn't let being unskilled deter you from letting it rip.

 In summation: Find your idols, admire them, and kill them. Kill them beautifully and passionately.

 Godspeed.

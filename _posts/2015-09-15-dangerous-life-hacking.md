It’s rare that a word with a very negative connotation gets a second chance, but the term “hack” is a prime example of that rare occurrence. The word “hack” used to describe a person---ostensibly some sort of professional---who was terrible at what they did. In fact, a very telling definition, courtesy of Random House, reads as follows:

 **hack**

> (hæk)

> *n.*

> A person, esp. a professional, who surrenders individual independence,
> integrity, belief, etc., in return for money or other reward.

<!--more-->
Other definitions include an old, ill-bred horse, the activity of
driving a taxi for money, or a writer who writes low-level drivel for
money. None of them are positive.

Even the the verb definitions sound negative:

> *v.i.*
>
> **1.** to make rough cuts or notches.
>
> **2.** to cough harshly, usually in short and repeated spasms.

Rough cuts? Harsh coughs? Spasms? Not sounding desirable. And yet, the
term “hack” is now enshrined in positive associations. And yet now,
“hacks” are much sought-after tricks, shortcuts, tiny little solutions
to myriad problems in life, love, and business, offered up to get you
what you want more quickly and easily.

If you are so inclined, you could spend years combing through the search
results for webpages where the word “hack” is a prime constituent. It
seems that everyone is looking for a hack, and many more are writing
about them, and their supposed glory.

But I am skeptical.

I used to be a wholehearted supporter of hacks, especially
“lifehacks”---those little tricks that promise huge returns for even
*less* work. I longed for more and more neat little shortcuts to do
more, get more, be more. Alas, I am coming to find that these tricks are
just that---tricks, as in they *trick* you into thinking something that
is not true. They trick you into thinking that you somehow exploited a
loophole in the universe, and jumped ahead to the front of the line,
without having to wait like everyone else. Unfortunately, this is not
true.

In essence, these little hacks trick you (and others) into thinking that
you have somehow altered the nature of life, when in reality, you’ve
only hacked your perception of it. You have only hacked yourself.

### What Hacks Really Are

To be more specific, in using a “hack”, you’ve only really done one of
two things. You either:

1.  Renegotiated or eliminated the commitment to---or desire for---a
    result, putting in its place some other---usually more
    quickly/easily achieved result.
2.  *Acting* as if effort or cost has been cut out, when it has actually
    been deferred or shifted elsewhere.

In either case, you have not figured out a shorter distance than a
straight line between A and B ; you have NOT changed the terrain.
Rather, you have changed your *perception* of the terrain—you have either
*found* the straight line between A and B where others were previously
taking a zig-zagging path---or you have realized that though you and
most others thought that B was the desired destination point, it’s
actually some less distant point,C, which is easier to reach.

### Why Hacking is Dangerous

So, given all of this, hacking can be dangerous, and I think that our
obsession with it may in fact already be putting us in danger.

You see, the more we continue to measure the success of people,
products, and businesses by how much they hack, innovate, and disrupt,
the more we may just be working toward the wrong goals. In
addition---and perhaps more dangerously---I think we run the very real
risk of eliminating our capacity for patiently and slowly doing good
work. That being the case, I am scared that we may also be running the
risk of coming to value very few of the things we create.

It’s a simple thing, really: you expend 1/2 the amount of time and
energy on something, you’re bound to care about 1/2 as much about it.
It’s not necessarily a law, but I challenge you to look at examples of
it in your life---they’re there, if you pay attention. Sure, how much
you value something is heavily a function of how useful it is, but just
think of this: the constant innovation and hacking we do makes the
usefulness of products and services go obsolete at a much faster rate. I
valued my Samsung Blackjack at one time; I wouldn’t even use it as a
doorstop now.

Value concerns aside, hacks and workarounds are dangerous
because---quite simply---you can’t fool the universe. You *will* expend
the necessary effort, one way or another---at one *time* or another.
Maybe not even you, but the effort will be expended by someone,
somewhere down the line.

Case in point:

1.  **The Sweet Tooth Hack:** You can’t fool your body with artificial
    sweeteners---you will crave sweets after your Diet Coke, and expend
    that much more energy restraining yourself form tearing into that
    chocolate cake once you’ve guzzled your diet beverage.
2.  **The Cheapskate Hack**: You can’t fool the IRS with elaborate
    loopholes and tax shelters---without making way more work for
    yourself, and an immense psychological burden.
3.  **The Fidelity Hack**: You can’t fool someone close to you by trying
    to hide the truth and sneak around behind their back---without
    spending just as much effort as would have been spent if you were to
    be upfront and tell the truth.

These are just 3 cases, but ones like them abound. There is some amount
of work that must be done for each objective one has. There are
inefficient ways to do things, for sure. There are also efficient ways
to do things, up to a point. Past that, there are ways to complete an
objective which do get one the desired objective with what seems like
less work. That work, however, goes somewhere else---either to some*one*
else or to some*time* other than now.

I fear that now, perhaps we are taking on that extra effort that we
thought we were circumventing as we hacked and innovated away, and that
it will someday become too much for us to bear. Take for example the
financial crisis that came to a head in 2007 and 2008. Draw up whatever
narrative you like of the whole thing---who were the heroes, the
villains, the victims, etc. One thing will have to be present in any
account of the crisis: it would not have happened as it did without the
financial “innovations” and “hacks” known as credit default swaps and
derivatives. These instances of financial wizardry barely passed the
sniff test of shrewd investors like Warren Buffett who, 5 years before
the meltdown, described them as no less than [“financial weapons of mass
destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially
lethal.”](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf)

I see a similar “hack” gone awry in the new “gig economy” that has
cropped up in Uber, Zirtual, Air BnB, and the like. We’re trying to take
shortcuts in building a market, and it’s going to bite us in the behind.
As it tends to happen, a few people laugh all the way to the bank, and
many others cry into their pillows, wake up, and get a job as a Wal-Mart
greeter, rather than retire. I’m no futurist, so you can take this grave
prediction with a grain of salt. Suffice it to say, I see a familiar
pattern emerging. It may be merely coincidental, and not of the same
form; time will tell.

If you managed to read this whole thing, congratulations and thank you.

For those who prefer to skim for heading type, below is the takeaway:

### In Short:

Hacking is dangerous because we believe we are changing or bending the
rules of reality, but we are not. Rather, in many cases, we are merely
shifting around the effort we think we’re saving or settling for a lower
quality outcome.

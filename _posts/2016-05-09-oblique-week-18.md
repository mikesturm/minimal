*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and writes a meditation upon it. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}). The Oblique Strategies are copyright Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt*

When someone steals something from you, especially something valuable, how does that make you feel? You feel violated, right? You feel insecure. It affects everything for a while. Your whole view of things is changed, at least for a time. It makes it difficult to be at ease, and thus difficult to do anything else.

Surely, you would do all you could to prevent future theft, right? You would lock your doors. You may set up an alarm system. You may ask your neighbor or a friend to watch over your house when you're away. The point is, you don't want to lose the things you value, and so you safeguard them. It's about more than the possessions, though. You don't want people intruding upon your sanctuary---your private space. It is as basic an instinct as there is.

But I have news for you, friends. You've left yourself open for theft, and you are being stolen from every day. You're being robbed of two very valuable things: your time and attention.[^1] Though I think that nearly everyone believes that these things are important, we don't often act that way. I allow any old thing to have my time and attention---at least for a few minutes. I guard them poorly.

But why is this? Why do we lock our houses, vehicles, and possessions securely, but do little to keep our time and attention from being stolen away by every little thing?

When was the last time you sat working on some project as you watched TV? What about when you pulled out your phone during a conversation because you felt it buzz? Do you find yourself checking your email while you're working on something, without taking a defined break---with a hard start and stop---you just wander over to it? What about your feeds on Facebook, Twitter, or Medium? These are all instances of theft.

But here's the thing: they're *worse* than mere theft. It's more like being swindled by a con man. You're *willingly* giving up your time and attention---and for what? For the false promise of some momentary pleasure? It's worse than you think. Studies have shown that once you shift your attention off of your work for even a minute, [it can take as much as 23 minutes to focus on that work again.](https://www.yast.com/time_management/science-task-interruption-time-management/)

For those doing creative work, grand larceny of our attention can be a death sentence. Momentum is so key to the kind of thought involved in writing, art, music, design---none of us can afford afford to break it.  But breaking it is so damned easy; and it keeps getting easier.


This week's Oblique Strategy recommends the following:

>Put in Earplugs

You can take this literally, and it may help you. But consider what actual earplugs do, and ask yourself how these effects can be emulated by employing other means. They:

- Drown out the noise of the world
- Good earplugs will only block out what is too loud and damaging to your ears.
- Earplugs are temporary. They can and should be taken out after a time.

The earplugs you choose can be anything, but the important thing is that they perform the function of filtering out all of the wandering thieves that steal your time and attention away from you work. You don't need to know all of the new developments, all of the updates. Are you interested in making news, or making history?

But like real earplugs, they don't help you if they block out the entire world. You need the world; you wouldn't make any sense without it. Do all you can to show that the converse is true. Do good work; and do so by safeguarding the time and attention you need to do it.

Godspeed.

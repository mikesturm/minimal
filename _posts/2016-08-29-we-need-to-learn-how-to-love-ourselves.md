</figure><h4>Because what we’re doing to ourselves is not love</h4>
<p>I have been writing online — on and off — for about a decade now. It started innocently enough, just airing my thoughts to literally no one, or a few personal friends. It has since elevated to something more, and I’ve found myself getting sucked into the culture of self-improvement and 10x-ing that is ubiquitous on the internet.</p>
<p>I see people with <em>waaaaaay </em>more followers than I have, getting way more shares, likes, recommends, and retweets than me. I see people my age buying, running, and selling businesses. I see them sipping gorgeous drinks on even <em>more </em>gorgeous beaches. I see them getting book deals, and giving TED talks.</p>
<p>I see all of that, and my confidence is crushed — right then and there. Do you ever find yourself feeling like that? I’m going to work off of the assumption that you do. So, you can stop reading here if you don’t.</p>
<p>Why do we get so disheartened by all of this success around us? Why is it so hard to just keep going — to carry on? Allow me to offer up two possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>We’re doing too much — we just don’t know it.</strong> Often times, when we are doing creative work, we are doing too many things at once. We have stopped simply <em>creating</em> and letting things <em>flow</em> through us, and have begun analyzing, criticizing, and planning — all at the same time as we’re trying to make something. These are all different job descriptions, with different workflows, and they get in the way of one another. So when we do these myriad other things — at many times unknowingly — we exhaust ourselves. We scorch the earth behind us, and make it that much harder to put out work later on.</li>
<li>
<strong>We allow expectations and desires to be the drivers of our work.</strong> As most creatives can attest, we expect a lot from ourselves. We expect both a lot of <em>volume</em> and a lot of <em>quality</em> work. We also tend to expect it quickly. As anyone in quality control or project management can tell you, <a href="http://www.sixside.com/fast_good_cheap.asp" target="_blank">you can’t have all three of those things</a>. For one thing, when you have desires and expectations of creative work right off the bat, in what way are you allowing yourself a free and <em>stress-free</em> environment in which to really create? Sure, you may well have a goal — something you want to convey with your work — but at least until you gain momentum, don’t let that goal be a set of shackles on your process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>A Simple Suggestion: Love Yourself Enough to do Poorly</h3>
<p>You’re not always going to knock it out of the park. In fact, most of the time, you won’t even get a base hit. You will need to come to grips with that, otherwise, you will continue to drive yourself your own unique brand of crazy.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage" target="_blank">field goal percentage in basketball</a> is just above .500 — in other words, making just over 50% of shots one takes. In baseball, a good batting average is even worse — .275 or over — meaning that just over 1 out of every 4 times at bat results in a hit. The point is this: you should fully expect to — at best — make something good (not great, but just <em>good</em>) one out of 4 times <em>at best</em>. To expect more than that is probably just a creative form of self-torture.</p>
<p>So wouldn’t it be nice if instead of trying to make something really awesome right now, you just <em>carried on</em> with the process of making <em>something</em> — being okay with a .300 batting average — which is <em>excellent</em>? Wouldn’t it be nice to give yourself the benefit of the doubt — go <em>easy</em> on yourself this time? I think it would.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: this is not an endorsement of being lax or of not caring. It is, in fact, the opposite. If you really <em>care</em> about your work, you will also <em>care</em> for and about the person who makes it — YOU. Part of really caring about yourself is treating yourself with respect and tempering unreasonable expectations. I think that a lot of us really fail miserably at this . We expect <em>way</em> too much from ourselves, way too quickly. We take each missed shot as an indicator that we are terrible as artists or creators. This is a mistake. We need to go easier on ourselves.</p>
<h3>The Psychological Basis</h3>
<p>One of the newer waves of behavioral therapy is called ACT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. One of its creators, Stephen C. Hayes has an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/get-out-your-mind/200903/compassion-the-child-within" target="_blank">interesting exercise wherein he asks us to imagine ourselves as a child</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Acceptance is taking in your history as it is … much like giving that child a hug. The compassionate part of us would not slap a child for feeling fear or sadness, yet we do the functional equivalent so readily to ourselves as adults.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>…the only way the child part of us can be listened to, respected, loved, cared for, and allowed to play is if the grown up part of us chooses a vital and self-compassionate path, that acknowledges pain and yet carries it forward into a life worth living. It is sometimes hard to find a place to do that for ourselves. If that is the case, there is an alternative. Imagine yourself as a child, and a time when a hurt you are feeling now was first being felt. Do it for that child.</em></blockquote>
<p>Think about it. Would you stand over a 5-year-old version of yourself who was playfully painting a landscape, humming and having fun, and tell them that what they’re doing just isn’t working — that they’re just not capturing the movement of the scene? No, unless you’re heartless, you wouldn’t.</p>
<p>A 5-year-old is just exploring, playing around, figuring things out — and that’s why they’re not tearing their hair out in front of their half-finished piece; they’re just carrying on. How great would it be if you treated yourself with just a fraction of the consideration you would give to that 5-year-old?</p>
<p>It’s not so far-fetched. Aren’t you still exploring, playing around, figuring things out? Yes, you probably are — but if you are not, then in the interest of really being creative, <strong>you should be</strong>. Don’t forget that the process of exploring, experimenting, and elucidating ideas can leave a lot of not-so-good work in its wake. But <em>do </em>that work, because it needs to be done.</p>
<p>You need to realize that what you are working on right now is okay — it may not be good now, but perhaps it <em>needs</em> to be done, and done badly, for your story to properly unfold.</p>

<h4>And How Honest Folks Can Use Them</h4>
<p>Victor Lustig was perhaps one of the most successful and notorious con-artists in modern times. He was persuasive enough to con two different businessmen to “buy” the Eiffel Tower from him (which, of course, he <em>didn’t</em> own). He even pulled off a scam where he got Al Capone to <em>give</em> him $68,000 (in 2016 dollars), f<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lustig#Later_years" target="_blank">or failing at an imaginary investment scheme</a>.</p>
<p>Lustig attributed his success to a set of principles that he called <a href="http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/02/10-commandments-for-con-men.html" target="_blank">the 10 commandments for con-men</a>. They are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast talking, that gets a con-man his coups).</p>
<p>2. Never look bored.</p>
<p>3. Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them.</p>
<p>4. Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones.</p>
<p>5. Hint at sex talk, but don’t follow it up unless the other fellow shows a strong interest.</p>
<p>6. Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown.</p>
<p>7. Never pry into a person’s personal circumstances (they’ll tell you all eventually).</p>
<p>8. Never boast. Just let your importance be quietly obvious.</p>
<p>9. Never be untidy.</p>
<p>10. Never get drunk.</p>
<p>What is interesting about these principles is that in and of themselves, they are not immoral. In fact, one could very easily cite these as a great way to conduct oneself while doing legitimate business, or even just conducting polite conversation in society. And yet, these are the same principles that allowed Victor Lustig to be so successful at conning people that he was wanted by 45 different law enforcement agencies around the world.</p>
<p>A clear lesson to learn here is that there really is a thin line between a strategic business deal and an epic con. That line is basically intent. If you use these very effective principles with the intent to exploit another person, you have just pulled off a con. But if you use these principles with the aim of establishing a good business relationship — with mutual benefit and sustainable give and take — then you’ve conducted a really good business deal.</p>
<p>In general, these principles are like any tool. They are not themselves good or bad — they are merely <em>effective. </em>What makes all the difference is the purpose for which they are used. If you choose to use them with an eye toward fairness, you can indeed go far. But if you choose to use them with the goal of only enriching yourself, at the cost of others, that’s what makes you a con-artist.</p>
<p>So the question to ask yourself is this: <em>am I using my tools in a way that is mutually beneficial, or am I using them to exploit others?</em> The answer you give is what makes the difference between a good business approach and simple huckstering.</p>

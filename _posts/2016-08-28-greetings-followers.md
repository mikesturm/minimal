<p>So, this week, I decided that aside from publishing my stuff in others’ publications, I’d make my own publication as well. I’m glad that you have hopped aboard my train.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what this will be, yet, but I hope that it’ll be something that you find valuable. That is my overarching goal — to bring value to those who read my writing. I aim to do this by exploring interesting ideas, and offering my take on them — at least my take <em>at that particular time</em>.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts about things you’d like to see me put in print, feel free to <a href="mailto:mike@yourfool.com" target="_blank">drop me a line</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for hopping aboard!</p>

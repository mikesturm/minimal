Gary Vaynerchuk posted [this article on Medium](https://medium.com/@garyvee/why-i-m-excited-about-the-new-audio-recording-app-anchor-5022a34e10ac#.ajzk8k3gl) about [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/), the new recording/radio app/site. It reads like a combination between productivity tool post and advertisement for the product. It may well be a cool product; I haven't tried it yet, but that has nothing to do with my point.

In the replies to this story, there was the following reply, which stopped me in my scrolling tracks:

It just rubbed me the wrong way. Here is a post about using a new product in what may be a fun new way to create stuff, and here's a guy who jumps in asking if Gary Vaynerchuk knows anyone in India who can transcribe on the cheap. To me, it just smacks of some exploitative BS.

Perhaps this is residual first-world guilt *cum* outrage about how globalization has played out, manifesting in me. Perhaps I'm just looking for an excuse to blow up at someone I perceive to be another entrepreneurial blowhard (I mean, c'mon! His profile describes him as a 10x thinker?!!). Perhaps it's just the combination of the suit and the pose in the profile picture. Perhaps it's the audacity clearly displayed by some dude shouting out to Gary Vaynerchuk in a comment on his Medium post, as if it were just a casual conversation, and asking if one of *those* people in India would transcribe his (undoubtedly 10x) thoughts for him (with the implication being that they'd do it on the cheap). It just seems ostentatious and gauche to me, the whole damned thing. That's all I got.

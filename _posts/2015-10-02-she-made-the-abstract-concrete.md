<h3>She Made the Abstract Concrete</h3>
<p>You hear the maxims countless times as you grow up:</p>
<blockquote>Family comes first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There’s no love like the love a parent feels for their child.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Giving is better than receiving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>They grow up so fast, cherish these moments.</blockquote>
<p>I kind of always paid lip service to these maxims, and agreed with them in principle. But they were always in the abstract for me — always on paper, but never in practice.</p>
<p>Then I had this lovely lump of joy plopped into my life.</p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">When we packed up for the move, we decided to take her with.</figcaption></figure><p>I guess that’s not the most accurate way to describe it. She was planned, meticulously, and so not really <em>plopped</em> into my life. I — well, my lovely wife and I — chose to have her in our life. It is one of the best choices I’ve made thus far, and the best collaborative project that I’ve been involved in to date.</p>
<p>She doesn’t know it yet, but she has already provided a service for which I can probably never fully repay her: she made the abstract concrete.</p>
<p>You see, before I had a child, I was focused on building a life that was very much about work. My dream was to build a kick-ass career, throw myself headlong into it, and — as time allowed — bask in that success with my family. My fulfillment was to come from my career. My sense of achievement, my validation as a human, etc. —was all set up in my mind to come from my career. That has all changed, and I am so glad that it has.</p>
<p>I have a lot of trouble getting out of my own head, and it has caused me some serious problems in my past. Having a little person whose very growth and journey toward fulfillment depends largely on me, well that tends to knock me about the head a bit, making it difficult to stay in there all by my lonesome. It makes it easier for me to see my career as something that helps me to provide a structure for her, and in turn, helps me respect my wife’s career as her own way of doing the same thing. It reminds us both that though we may be chasing immortality, our best bet for that goal is this little one (and other other little ones we might produce). Our success as a couple, and a working couple, can be measured by something more than the promotions we receive, and the funds we bring in. We now have a person whose own flourishing will be the manifestation of just how well we did.</p>
<p>But whereas I have begun to realize the concrete examples of the above maxims, I hear them less and less these days — especially on Medium, which seems to have utterly fetishized startups and entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4>F*#k Your Series A</h4>
<p>So, entrepreneurs, entrepreneur-worshipers, and startup fanboys — hear me now: fuck a series A, if your kids end up being <a href="http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">terrible people</a>. Also, hear this (especially my fellow millennials): it’s okay to work a 9-to-5 for someone else, and not own your own business, as long as you’re satisfied and your family is, too. Don’t make the mistake of adopting some business idol’s lofty and ego-fueled goals as your own — you don’t have to be grandiose to be a noble person. It is noble to do honest work and go home for the evening, and be some little person’s hero. This is a concrete version of one of the many abstract things I mistakenly assumed I agreed with before. I have my wife and daughter to thank for that.</p>
<p>To clarify: getting your startup from the garage to Menlo Park is fine, but there are other, less glamorous goals worth pursuing. If you don’t believe me, just give them a try. Sit down and build blocks with your toddler, then laugh together as she knocks it all down. It’s pretty damned fulfilling — if you just calm the hell down and let it be.</p>

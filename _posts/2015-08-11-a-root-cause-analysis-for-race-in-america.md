</figure><h2>A Root Cause Analysis for Race in America</h2>
<h4>The 5 Whys</h4>
<p>Anyone who’s worked for a company that gets excited about quality assurance has likely heard the famous allegory illustrating why you have to keep asking questions even when solutions appear to answer them. The <a href="http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/archives/2011/05/some_years_ago.shtml" target="_blank">story goes (roughly) like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Some years ago, there was a big problem at one of America’s most treasured monuments — the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Simply put, birds — in huge numbers — were pooping all over it, which made visiting the place a very unpleasant experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Attempts to remedy the situation caused even bigger problems, since the harsh cleaning detergents being used were damaging the memorial.</blockquote>
<p>The problem seemed clear, the birds’ poop was the problem, and the damage was just fallout from trying to handle the birds and their, well…shit. So solving the issue would require focusing on the birds, as they were the real cause. Blame the birds.</p>
<p>But as those familiar with the story know, the birds’ activity was not the root cause — it was a mere link in the chain of causes of the problem. Those tasked with solving the problem employed the practice of asking <em>why? </em>5 times in order to get at the root of the issue. It went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>The Jefferson Memorial was disintegrating</em></strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>Why? Use of harsh chemicals<br>Why? To clean pigeon poop<br>Why so many pigeons? They eat spiders and there are a lot of spiders at monument<br>Why so many spiders? They eat gnats and lots of gnats at monument<br>Why so many gnats? They are attracted to the light at dusk.<br>Solution: Turn on the lights at a later time.</blockquote>
<p>By merely turning the lights on later, the issue was resolved. If any of the other <em>whys</em> had been deemed the finally question, the solution would have solved one problem, by replacing it with another, or spending a lot of money unnecessarily.</p>
<h4>Using the 5 Whys for a Major Social Issue</h4>
<p>We can very easily, and I think we <em>should</em> turn loose the 5 whys mentality on a difficult and relevant social issue: race in America. Let’s focus for a bit on one particular problem case: the protesting and police reaction to it in Ferguson, MO.</p>
<blockquote>Without getting prescriptive and talking about who is in the right or wrong, let’s just admit that there is a problem — which I think is something everyone can agree upon.</blockquote>
<p>Great, let’s now move on to the work that will yield some good returns. Let’s start asking questions.</p>
<blockquote><strong>There is an outbreak of vitriolic protest in Ferguson</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>Why? <em>Black folks are angry.</em><br>Why? <em>(should probably ask them, but…)They feel that they are not treated fairly by police.</em><br>Why do they feel that way? <em>An unarmed black teen was shot there last year with no legal fallout, numerous other unarmed black men have been killed by police recently, and nothing appears to have changed.</em><br>Why is there that perception? <em>Because black folks are still arrested, assaulted, or imprisoned in a much higher proportion to white people, by white officers.</em><br>Why does this happen? <em>There is likely an operating bias in police officers that favors taking defensive or preemptive action against black men.</em><br>Solution: <em>Change the bias.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, 5 whys isn’t enough. So allow me to indulge into one more deep dive:</p>
<blockquote><strong><em>There is an operating bias in police officers that favors taking defensive or preemptive action against black men.</em></strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>Why? <em>A high percentage of known criminals are black men.</em><br>Why? (<em>good question…) More black men than white men find themselves selling drugs, in gangs, or committing thefts.</em><br>Why? <em>A disproportionate amount of blacks live in very poor, urban areas, with crumbling business and infrastructure.</em><br>Why? <em>Until roughly the 1960s, economic mobility for blacks was kept relatively low, and so neighborhood enrichment for black neighborhoods was a non-starter.</em><br>Why ? <em>Before 1960, many laws that date back to the time of slavery — which existed to limit opportunities to people of color — enforced a system of inequality on blacks by whites.</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Solution: <em>????????</em>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see where I’ve hit a roadblock. And I want to stress that all of the above are examples of questions and answers that could follow a natural course of inquiry — not definitive social analysis on my part. However, while I don’t stand by the specifics of what is above, I stand by the general form of asking questions. Asking more than 3 or 4 questions as “answers” are given for this problem reveals something:</p>
<blockquote>A problem like the racial tension we see today — upon a deeper inquiry — looks very different once some deeper questions are asked. We begin to see how much a certain portion of society may have been set up to fail.</blockquote>
<h4>Going Forward</h4>
<p>Here’s the good news: we need not concern ourselves with admissions of who is at fault in order to begin fixing the problem. When we know what the problem is, we can begin taking action to fix the fundamental problem, and begin reaping the rewards. The issue becomes whether we as people involved can separate identifications of root cause from admissions of guilt. In most cases, such a separation is difficult to make.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the same half-assed assessments of the problem get re-hashed again and again, every generation or so. We ask 3 whys, everyone gets angry and defensive, and nothing is done. Let’s take this time to start asking why, and keep asking, until we hit the root.</p>

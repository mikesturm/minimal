*This is part 3 of a 3 part series on better communication through the 3:1 rule. For the full rundown of this rule, see [Part 1]({% post_url 2015-06-15-3-1-rule-part-1 %}), and for elaboration, see [Part 2]({% post_url 2015-07-04-3-1-rule-part-2 %}).*

I have previously written about the firs two parts of more effective communication---what I call the 3:1 rule. The [first part]({% post_url 2015-06-15-3-1-rule-part-1 %}) is to wait 3 beats before speaking during a conversation. The [second part]({% post_url 2015-07-04-3-1-rule-part-2 %}) is to (roughly) ask 3 questions for every 1 statement that you make. This final part of the 3:1 rule deals with how make a statement when you do finally make one. Simply put, the principle is as follows:

<!--more-->

**If you do make a statement, limit it to a maximum of 3 sentences in support of 1 main point. Think of it as an argument with a maximum of 3 premises and 1 conclusion---“I think X, because: this, that, and the other reason."**

Those who have taken a logic course will recognize the suggested structure here. It’s a simple argumentative style in (ideally) deductive form. You make your statement, and then provide your reasons in support of it. These reasons should be ones that---if they are true---then it will be quite hard to deny your overall statement. Ideally, you’ll be presenting a valid and sound argument, but it’s not important to get that technical for the purposes of this principle.[^1]

### Bullet Thinking, Bullet Speaking

This part of the 3:1 rule, which I like to call the “Bullet Principle”, is useful because it gets you both thinking *and* speaking in bullet points---specifically bullets that support the main point you want to make. This will help you communicate better because you will be thinking in terms of your reasons for the conclusions that you’ve come to, and how those reasons support your conclusions. When you communicate in this way, you can avoid misunderstandings, losing people’s interest, and other pitfalls of communication.

There is a reason why bullet points are utilized in presentations and textbooks---they are effective. Bullet points present bite-sized, discrete pieces of information that your mind can glom onto. They give the mind definite footholds in a mountain of information. If you can harness the power of bullet points in your thinking and speaking, you can focus listeners’ attention on what you are really trying to say. You can also focus your *own* attention on a clear, linear, and orderly presentation of your thoughts.

While thinking in terms of bullets and arguments, you may also find that you end up speaking less often, as you can’t really find the 3 premise, 1 conclusion format of what you want to say. Some of the things you might be *aching* to say during a conversation might actually have little to support them. Holding off on saying them might not be the end of the world, and it might just save you from saying things that you just haven’t thought through enough.

### The End of Logorrhea

But notice that this part of the 3:1 rule states that *at most* you should use 3 sentences in support of 1 main point. That means that you can use *less* than 4 total sentences when you’re offering up your thoughts. While this may seem constraining at first (because it is), it may ultimately keep you from perhaps the worst offense in the realm of communication: the long, rambling, think-out-loud soliloquy. There are few better ways to lose people’s attention than a stream-of-consciousness ramble through your hedge-maze of thoughts. People may be interested in your opinions, but they will quickly lose interest in your dizzying process of deciding upon them.

When you only have 4 total sentences with which to make your point, the odds of your verbal offering being a meandering monologue decrease substantially. Trust me, your interlocutors will appreciate this, and it will only serve to boost your credibility.

But back to saying *less* than 4 sentences. You can just as often state your opinion succinctly in *one* sentence. If it’s interesting enough, or if it begs for a bit of elaboration, someone will ask you for it. A bonus here; when someone *asks* you to elaborate on what you said, they’re more likely to listen better to what you’ll say next. Thus, we have case of less truly being more---saying less yields more interest in your point.

### Bringing it All Together

I would be remiss if I didn’t apply this last part of the 3:1 rule to the 3:1 rule, so here goes:

* Main idea: In order to more effectively communicate, you need to allow others time to speak, and yourself time to think, ask more and better questions, and be succinct and clear in making your statements.
* Wait 3 beats after a speaker finishes speaking before interjecting your piece in a conversation---it allows others time to speak, and you time to think.
* Ask 3 questions for each 1 statement you make.
* When you do make a statement, be clear and succinct by using at most 3 statements in support of 1 conclusion statement.

So there you have it---the principles of better communication---with a bullet.

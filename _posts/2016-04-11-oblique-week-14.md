## Stillness, Breath

If you're reading an article like this, I probably don't have to remind you that focusing on breathing is at the root of re-calibrating yourself---body and mind. This is the main principle that underlies pretty much any form of meditation. That's because it works. The great thing is, it's an easy principle to realize.

Just breathe deeply---*try it*. Feel that? You will likely feel a wave of something like relaxation come over you---perhaps just for a second or two. It is the quickest and most accessible way to just reset yourself. Especially when your mind has become like a sports car in mud---engine going at several thousand RPMs, wheels spinning in the mud, going nowhere.

This is no secret. People have been doing it for centuries---*millennia* even. Thousands of articles have been written about the simple act of consciously breathing. It's a real thing.

And why not? Breathing is the most fundamental expression of yourself. It is the quickest, most accessible way to re-express, re-assert what you are---here and now. It is, in many ways, the fundamental act of simultaneous *destruction* and *creation*. You are---in the act of breathing in and out---destroying what you were, and creating what you are now. Wait for a second, and understand what that means.


## Creation, Destruction

The fact is, we're constantly creating---creating ourselves in each moment. Real creativity comes when we realize this and capitalize upon it---when we capture that creative act and express it at a higher level---in prose, poetry, music, or images. In a way, we are [chasing the dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_the_dragon#Metaphorical) that is never more than a breath away. There is comfort in that, so *take* comfort in coming to understand it. You are a creative person---with each breath you take.

There is a wonderful quote from one of my favorite books, [*Not Always So* by the late Shunryu Suzuki](http://www.amazon.com/Not-Always-So-Practicing-Spirit/dp/0060957549):

>Usually our society works in a superficial, frivolous way. The controlling power is money or some big noise. Our eyes and ears are not open or subtle enough to see and hear things....Those who are accustomed to big noises may not notice, but we can communicate without talking so much. We may not always be smiling, but we feel what others are feeling. Our mind is always open, and we are expressing ourselves fully.

Suzuki is referring, at the end of the quote, to those practicing meditation skillfully---people who have found a way to just sit and express themselves, knowing themselves fully here and now. It's an ideal worth striving for, but difficult to achieve---and needing attention in order to maintain.


## Never Not Working

The point of this maxim is to realize that when you take pen away from paper, brush away from canvas, or whatever, you're not falling behind. So often, I end up scolding myself for not putting my head down and slaving away at whatever concrete piece of work I've pushed myself to do. By doing that, I rob myself of the real power of just expressing myself as a conscious, breathing human. I rob myself of the natural expression that Suzuki talks about. There is so much to observe in oneself and in others, as we all go about the business of existing---from day to day, from moment to moment. Even when there are strict parameters of how we ought to do the work we're doing, we exhibit creativity and variation---most of the time without even realizing it.

Make no bones about it, this is not a piece telling you that you need to ramp up your creative efforts, and suggesting how to do that. I'm saying that you need to realize that you are constantly creating and expressing---even when you're not technically working, so take comfort in that. You are never *not* doing creative work, so long as you are coming to know and express yourself more fully. And this can be as easy as consciously breathing.

I really believe in the need to give ourselves and others a break---to go easy, and assume we are (for the most part) doing the best we can, for now. This is not to say that we shouldn't push ourselves and others to do better. Rather, we need to strike a balance between complacency on one hand, and a drive to do better on the other. We very often end up swinging from far on one side---a helpless frustration---to the other---a mad dash to somehow urgently shove ourselves and others into excellence. Neither is good. Neither will work. But as obvious as it sounds, we tend to forget that in the practice of living. We get anxious, fearful, angry, and desirous, and we quickly and clumsily grasp at straws---looking for the comfort of short-lived gains. They give us very little real benefit.

Just because I've written this doesn't mean I'm any less susceptible to it all. I struggle with it, as I am sure you do---as everyone does. The mistake is thinking you can transcend this struggle. You will likely never do that. Realizing that it's a struggle, and realizing the need to recalibrate yourself is the the takeaway.

And that can be as easy as watching your breath---here and now.

Godspeed.

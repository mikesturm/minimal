<h3>Times Like These</h3>
<h4>Or: Mountain Time</h4>
<p>It’s 11pm Mountain Time here in my hotel room in El Paso. I’m a literal stone’s throw away from where a wall will supposedly be soon built. Dizzy Gillespie's “All the Things You Are” emanates softly from my phone’s speakers. I’m still not used to Mountain Time.</p>
<p>It’s times like these that I can do nothing but ponder — swimming through a Jello-dense sea of thoughts and feelings. Movement is so slow and exaggerated.</p>
<p>It’s times like these that I <em>feel </em>the profundity of life — not of events, people, the future, or anything specific — but life <em>as its own thing</em>. It’s unlike anything else, for both better <em>and</em> for worse — depending on who you ask, and when.</p>
<p>It’s times like these that I wonder why I feel the need to write about this hodgepodge of whatever has heaped itself into my mind. Times that I wonder if I’m actually <em>doing</em> anything at all as I write, or if perhaps I’m just on hand for this thing that is happening. I’m never quite sure.</p>
<p>It’s times like these that I wonder about writing. I wonder if it isn’t just the closest thing we have to what we believe gods do. I wonder why I still <em>don’t </em>believe in a soul. I also wonder why as I write this, I kind of <em>do.</em></p>
<p>It’s times like these that I also wonder about time, and then I think about writing, and how maybe we’re throwing sentences and paragraphs as nets to capture, tag, and domesticate time. Maybe we’re all on safari.</p>
<p>It’s times like these that I wish there were more times like these. And that I understand that if there were, I wouldn’t care about times like these.</p>

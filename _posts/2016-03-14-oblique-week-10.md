*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets them. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

I once heard a wise man say the following:

>priorities are like arms; if you think you have more than a couple, you're either lying or crazy.[^1]

If you devote a little bit of thought to it, this makes a lot of sense. If you don't believe me (and maybe you shouldn't---you don't know me!) take it from the same guy who said the quote above:

>priorities can only be observed. In my book, a priority is not simply a good idea; it's a condition of reality that, when observed, causes you to reject every other thing in the universe -- real, imagined, or prospective -- in order to ensure that things related to the priority stay alive.
>
Even though their influence informs every decision we make on the most tactical level, thinking about priorities happens at a strategic, "why am I here?" level.[^2]

This "why am I here?" level is the important level; it's where all the importance that any projects and tasks have, come from. And yet, we forget those important things constantly. We take our eyes off of the prize---so to speak. But it is easy to understand why that is. The prize is not moving; it's not buzzing in our ear or tugging at our pantleg.  It is distant and unmoving, no matter how many times we pivot or change direction.

When we think of creating something, we often conceive of it as being rooted in spontaneity---as a lightning bolt that strikes one who is otherwise a passive receiver. This simply is not the case. Even the most sudden flash of inspiration is the result of hours of thinking, agonizing, searching. In the same way that you can't magically get to Butte, Montana unless you're traveling there, you can't get inspired if you're not seeking it---in some way or another. And this analogy is even more useful if you think about the journey that we embark upon when we begin a project. We have a destination in mind---a message we'd like to get across---but we so often lose our way. We end up in Carson City, Nevada---far away from Butte (to further stretch my metaphor)---and we feel lost, in a very real way.

All of this is a long, meandering way of addressing this week's Oblique Strategy, which is:

>The most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten.

The above preamble about priorities is important because there are things which---for any given creative endeavor---are the priority. There is a message to convey, an emotion to illustrate, an audience to reach, etc. This is the ever-important *why* of "why am I doing this thing?" Losing touch with this *why* is almost always going to stymie your creativity on a given project.

But there is a *higher level*---a more abstract kind---of priority that we need to keep in front of mind, and that is the *why* of "why am I doing what I'm doing, *writ large*?"

These are not completely separate *whys*. The higher level "why am I even creating in the first place?" question directly informs the lower level "why am I doing this thing?" In the hot-air balloon of your creative energy, one is the balloon itself, into which hot air gathers and pushes you along. The other is the fire that burns the air an makes it hot in the first place. To have one without the other is nearly useless.

So what's my message here---behind all of this metaphorical fog? The message is that in order to achieve any worthwhile creative goal, you need to be in touch with your overall priorities. Not just your goal for this project, because *that* goal may not be at all in sync with your overall priorities. And if it isn't, that will bleed through the work in a very real way.  You also need to be in touch with your goals *as a person*---who you want to be, and what you want your life to be about. Again, if your aren't, it will show in your work---whether you notice it or not.

After all, if priorities are really *observed*, rather than assigned, then a primary job of the artist is to seek out that creative priority. You will know it when you find it. It'll be that thing that moves you---in that way that you can't help. It'll be that thing that cries out for you to express and give life to it. It will not, however, always be easily found. It may be the most soul-wrenching, taxing work you do. But the point is that this work of seeking and finding is part of the journey---a *vital* part. You don't just get to sit down with your tools and go create great things. That's not how it works. You need to be in touch with so many things as a person, let alone as a *creator*. It's not easy. But as I think you well know already, it some of the most worthwhile work that one can do.

Godspeed.

<h3>Two Quick Notes</h3>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I have two quick notes, and won’t take up much of your time.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am closing up <em>Your Fool Laureate</em>. I encourage you to follow a publication that my good friend, <a href="https://medium.com/u/b9d5f10bb3f3" target="_blank">Stephen M. Tomic</a> and I have founded: <a href="https://medium.com/the-junction" target="_blank"><em>The Junction</em></a>. It will be everything you’ve come to expect from me and then some.</li>
<li>I have had a newsletter for a while, but haven’t promoted it well. It’s picking up steam, and I’d like it if you could subscribe. Once per week, no spammy BS. It’s called “Woolgathering”. <a href="http://tinyletter.com/mike_sturm" target="_blank">Subscribe here.</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Godspeed</p>

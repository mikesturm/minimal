## Supply is Not the Problem

I am a member of a [leadership development group](http://www.rockfordchamber.com/events-programs/leadership_rockford.aspx) in my home-base area in Rockford, IL. Every other Friday, the group---made up of mid-level management people at local firms---gets together at a different location to learn. We learn about business development in the area, about leadership qualities, education, non-profits, and civic involvement.

A few weeks ago, we visited a food bank that serves about 15 counties in our area---meaning somewhere over 1 million people. The fellow representing the food bank revealed to us something very stunning. He said that where the food bank falls short is not where most people think it does. They have plenty of food---*plenty*. In fact, they're throwing away tons of food (literal tons) each year. They have plenty of volunteers to help process food---in most times of the year. The real problem the food bank faces, he said, is that tens of thousands of people in poverty are *not* using the food bank. For whatever reason, people are just not showing up to the pantries to get food. They don't come out to get food from the food trucks that the pantries support regularly. They just choose not to ask for help.

## Society Has Made Us Afraid of Help

I don't blame those people for not reaching out. I understand. Though I've never had to go hungry, I understand their affliction because I too suffer from it. This affliction is the refusal to ask for help.

This affliction is a widespread cultural phenomenon that preys upon millions of people---both rich and poor, young and old, working and unemployed. It has deep roots, and it keeps people who could otherwise be successful from getting somewhere. But why does this affliction persist? Why is it so damned hard to ask for help---especially when help is available?

I think that part of the problem comes form our national discourse here in the U.S. No matter how liberal we become socially, there remains an undercurrent of mythical rugged individualism. It began as the 20th century began---with the "rags to riches" stories of Horatio Alger. Even as the depression hit in the 1930s, people were urged to ["pick themselves up by the bootstraps"](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/debunking-bootstraps-myth/) and get out of abject poverty.

These days, the message is the same gift, but in a different package. We continue to be sold Algeresque stories, but instead of scrappy young boys from the slums, we get college dropouts who built computers and apps in their parents' garages. We are presented with odd stories of entrepreneurs starting and selling companies within a year or two for billions of dollars. To compound that, we are also bombarded by articles that urge us to adopt habits, read certain books, or take certain courses---the implication being that we too can learn to rise like those revered few rose---on our own. It's all a beautiful lie.

I hope we're not all too stupid to realize that this is just ideology repeating itself. None of these new paragons of success did it on their own---nobody ever has. Furthermore, no one who has really succeeded ever did it without asking for, and receiving, help. This is true, it has always been true, but somehow we continue to pass through the centuries forgetting it. This needs to stop. It only benefits the select few who already have success, fame, wealth, and influence. It buries the rest of us in social obstacles and self-doubt. The more the public at large shames those who ask for help, the more we'll repeat the cycle of terribly large numbers living and dying in poverty, living without realizing their potential---wasting away.


## How Do We Change This?

So I ask you, if you're still reading: how can I help you? How can you help me? How can we convince everyone that giving and receiving help is a good thing. Charity is not a bad word, it is help for those who don't have enough to repay. That's it. Fuck the [Protestant Work Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic#Basis_in_Protestant_theology). This is the 21st century, and we should be okay providing for those who are in trouble---whether we get anything back or not. Hell, we seem to be okay throwing billions of dollars at apps that never make any money. Why the hell should we act so stingy when it comes to providing housing, food, health care, and education to people. I doubt that the mythical ["welfare queens"](http://www.salon.com/2015/09/27/ronald_reagans_welfare_queen_myth_how_the_gipper_kickstarted_the_war_on_the_working_poor/) spent any more recklessly than a group of 20 year-old coders who thought they had the next yelp on their hands.

We're making progress on LGBT issues, we're making progress on gender issues, we're making progress on racial issues (okay, maybe we're stalled there). We're making no progress on issues with neediness and help. None. Nada. Zilch. The attitude of stingy judgmentalism remains as strong as ever---even as those who judge receive help regularly. In turn, those who need help are shamed into *not* asking for it. We can't be afraid to ask for help, but more importantly, we can't disgrace those who need to ask for it.

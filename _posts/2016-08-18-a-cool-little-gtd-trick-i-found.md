<h3>A Cool Little GTD Trick I Found</h3>
<h4>It’s even cooler if you use <a href="https://workflowy.com" target="_blank">WorkFlowy</a>.</h4>
<p>I’ve been an adherent of GTD for a few years now. I’m stumbling to use the system rigorously, but I certainly buy in.</p>
<p>That being said, anyone who’s trying to really do GTD likely understands that the weekly review is the most important part of the process. Without the habit of a weekly review to keep track of all the stuff you’ve collected and processed, your GTD system becomes something that stresses you out more than it helps you do things.</p>
<p>If you’ve done a weekly review before, you know that the checklist for one looks something like this (though it varies a bit from person to person):</p>

<p>What’s worse is that step 6 — reviewing projects, and ensuring that each has a next action in your list of next actions can be very tedious. The challenge that I’ve found is checking whether I have a next action for each open project in my list of next actions. There are a lot of each of them — there can be <em>hundreds</em> of each, in fact. If only there were an easy way to associate the two.</p>
<h4>Enter My Little Trick</h4>
<p>A hashtag and a number. That’s it. That’s my trick.</p>
<p>Any time I put a new project on a list of mine, I put a hashtag with a number in front of it. I started about two weeks ago at #1, and now I’m at #37. After being on vacation for a week and returning to the office, I suspect I will be surpassing #60 by week’s end. For each action item that is part of a project, I put the # and project number in front of it.</p>
<p>What this does is make running a GTD system much easier on 3 fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can open my list of projects and just run through it numerically. No more looking at a given project and having to scan through the hundred or so action items I have open to find a match.</li>
<li>My reference files (digital, mostly) now begin with the # and number scheme. That makes it super easy to find project support material, as well as store it as reference when the project is completed.</li>
<li>I use Workflowy, the wonderful list manager created by <a href="https://medium.com/u/37c44368dcb" target="_blank">Jesse Patel</a> &amp; company. I’ve used it for a few years now. When you use a # in front of a word or single number, it becomes a hyperlink. If you click it, it’s like an automatic filter that only shows things with that hashtag sequence. That makes my weekly review and project management much more fluid.</li>
</ol>

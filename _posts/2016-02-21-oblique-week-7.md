*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets them. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

The strategy for this week seems at first like an odd one. What makes it seem odd is that it is a question, rather than a suggestion. But when you think about it, isn't a question a more useful way to work through creative challenges? So here's the question this week:

>Is there something missing?

<!--more-->

Often times, we find ourselves stuck on a project, and we're just not sure what to do. Of course, that is what the *Oblique Strategies* were made for.  This question, though---asking if something is missing---can be a dangerous one to ask when you're stuck. If you ask it after you've put a bunch of work into what you're doing, it could send you into a frantic search for some illusory philosopher's stone, which will turn your dull, heavy project into the shiny gold you're after.

So be careful with this question. I propose you answer it in two different ways, or phases---one before the other---to get the most out of it.


## Phase 1: Addition by addition

Assume that something *is* missing, and begin adding things...feverishly.

This sounds absurd, and it is, but there is a purpose behind the madness: get rid of your attachments to the work you've done---by *drowning* them. You see, at least for me, I often find myself becoming way too attached to the sentences and paragraphs I have already typed. I forget that there is a difference between the media and the message (despite what [Marshall McLuhan may have said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#The_Medium_Is_the_Massage:_An_Inventory_of_Effects_.281967.29)).

As a writer, I'm not doing typography; my words are not the object of my pursuit. I am trying to convey a message, and if that message is good enough---if it's one worth conveying, I should be able to delete sentences and paragraphs in the service of conveying that message. But of course, I am weak. Each of my sentences is a unique and beautiful snowflake; each my only child, who I cannot let go.

This is where the addition strategy comes in. If i just keep adding sentences, paragraphs, ideas---I become less attached. I am more likely to just begin on a new, clean document, and forget about the words I clung to so tightly before.  In fact, that is usually the best thing to do, which brings me to phase 2 of the strategy.


## Phase 2: Addition by subtraction

Once you have heaved all of your energy onto one document, canvas, or whatever, without care of clogging up the work, you can more easily just leave it to the side and begin anew. It's like on those episodes of *Hoarders*, where the best strategy ends up being just throwing damn near everything out. That is what you're doing here, except you still have that work somewhere, and you still have your ideas. Also---and this is key---you still have made real progress.

People often think that what you have on your paper, your canvas, what has been edited into a video, as the progress that you as an artist have made. They are wrong. The real progress that an artist or creator of any kind makes is largely invisible. It is the progress of *thought*---the evolution of *ideas*, and it takes place through and manifests in the final product, but that is not where it lives. It lives inside the mind of the artist. More specifically, it lives in that space where the artist's mind conceives of the world---where it *makes sense* of the world. This is why those who fetishize material output and the crossing off of tasks are often confounded by the radical creatives tossing out hours of work and spent materials to start fresh. They mistakenly think that the real progress lived there---in those discarded things. Again, they are **wrong**.

I say all of this to reassure you that deleting paragraphs, erasing or drawing over lines, getting rid of slides, etc. is not deleting your progress. It is adding to it. You can add by subtracting, and that is what this second phase is about.

On a blank, new document, canvas, or what have you, begin again, with that momentum from your brain dump fresh in your mind. Going back to that *Hoarders* analogy: you're in a new house now, a clean one. So if you have an old house full of junk, and a new clean one, will you bring your collection of old chewing gum over to it? I think not. That's the strategy at work. There are probably a few things in your previous try that may make the cut, and land on the new piece. Likely, it will be a variation on something in the old piece. It will be a sentence or two that is the same in spirit as one you already wrote, but structurally different. And it won't have the weight of the neighboring sentences that used to keep it from soaring.

This very post was written using this method (how very *meta*!).
I've used it before on some of the best things I've written; it works. But starting the process is one of the hardest things to do. It's why that phrase "kill your darlings," [whoever actually said it first](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html), is so well known. Creators *know* they have to kill many of their creations, and it pains them to do it. But what is life without the promise of death? What is creation without the specter destruction as well? Both are worthless. And so it goes. We create via destruction, and in killing, we enrich life. How very Nietzsche of me.

Godspeed.

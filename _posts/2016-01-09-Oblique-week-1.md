*This is part of a series, running through 2016, in which your faithful fool randomly selects one of Eno and Schmidt's "Oblique Strategies" and analyzes and interprets them. For background on the series and the strategies, please read [the series introduction]({% post_url 2016-01-01-Oblique-resolution %}).*

So here it is, week 1 of my deep dive into Eno and Schmidt's *Oblique Strategies*, and boy was this first pick a *doozy*.
Here it is:

>"Change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency."

<!--more-->

I know what you're thinking: how is this going to help me be more creative? How will changing nothing be the catalyst that sets a creative revolution in motion? After all, this is the two-thousand-tens! We're innovators---disruptors! We're uberizing and life-hacking! To change *nothing* is to lay down on your sword in the heat of battle!

I hear you, friend, but consider this: perhaps the reason that you're stuck---and I'm assuming that you do get stuck, or else why would you bother reading this---is because you have not been following one path consistently. The urge to change, tweak, and hack can often be *so* strong that you end up making tweaks, changes, and alterations without even noticing. If you pay attention---*really* pay attention---to your process, I bet you'll catch yourself doing it. You started with a plan, a theme, a method.  But the minute---nay, the second---that things begin to look just a little like they were stalled, you tried to change course a little. You made a tweak, added a little something to your approach, or took something out. That seems like it would help to get you un-stuck, but consider what you are actually doing.



## A Tale of Two Clocks

There is an old saying, of which I'm sure most readers are aware, that even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Consider how that compares to a clock that is still ticking, but set to the wrong time.
While the former clock may not be moving, it still---*just by staying put*---gets it right twice per day. It does so consistently.
The latter clock---still moving and expending energy---never manages to be right, despite all of its movement.
Almost sounds like a koan, doesn't it?

Apply this analogy to your current creative path, the one that you perceive as not working. If it is indeed like a broken clock, then take comfort in the fact that you can at least count on still getting the right time twice per day, and  to boot, you'll know exactly when that will happen. De-abstratcting that statement, if you continue on as you were---despite the fact that you may no longer be passionate about it---making sure to stay consistent, you will end up getting some kind of results, even if they're not amazing results.
However, if you quickly resort to changing your approach, tweaking things, etc., you've then abandoned whatever benefits you may have reaped from consistently following one plan. What's worse, you've discarded an approach that you never gave a fair shot. After all, you pitched it mid-way through.

I promise, there *are* such benefits---hence the popularity of the maxim "done is better than perfect". Really, unless whatever project you're working on is the one that you're *absolutely certain* is going to be your last, why does it have to be perfect? Even if it *did*, for some reason, have to be perfect, what makes you so sure that whatever tweaks or changes you're thinking of making are going to make it perfect. Again, a broken clock, or a running one set to the wrong time? Given uncertainty, perhaps the former is the better strategy.  What's the worst that could happen? You actually *complete* the work that you've been bashing your head against the wall trying to complete? How terrible! But  guess what? You've now got momentum on your side. You're making stuff, you're producing. So start *another thing*, decide on a new approach to take, and just let that approach come to fruition, rather than mucking it up by modifying it with all sorts of tweaks and diversions along the way.


## The Benefit of Shifting Focus

There is one more beneficial aspect to this strategy of changing nothing, and it comes by way of the latter clause of the strategy: "...continue with immaculate consistency".

If it hadn't dawned you already, dear reader, not changing something actually takes a lot of work. I really do believe that we naturally veer toward inconsistency, when it comes to creative work. I know I tend to. When you're trying to be creative, the *last* thing you usually want to do is apply and enforce constraints. But constraints can be so (paradoxically) liberating. Furthermore, focusing on *enforcing* the constraints can take your mind off of the ways you perceive your work to be stuck, and focus on just working.

So, try this: lay out a framework for your project. Follow it---religiously. Focus on looking at the work done, and in process, and check it to ensure conformance to your framework. Analyze and judge; it can become a self-critique. You may be surprised to find what comes out of that process.


Godspeed.

<h4>I’ll save you the trouble of reading: yeah, I kind of think so.</h4>

<p>In 2008, in only the second presidential election in which I could legally vote, I found myself in awe. I had been so sure fore the months leading up to the election that America was not ready for a black president. I told anyone who would listen that it would take a miracle for this guy to win. Color me flabbergasted when on that fateful day in November, John McCain conceded, and Barack <em>Hussein</em> Obama became America’s first president of color.</p>
<p>I was jubilant for weeks thereafter. I was proud of us — as a country. We had taken a step in the right direction. But I couldn’t — for 7 or so years — shake this feeling that maybe it was too good to be true. It turns out, it was.</p>
<h3>And Now, Trump.</h3>
<p>I see the same excitement and groundswell of support for Donald Trump now that I saw for Barack Obama in 2008. Granted, it’s not from the same crowd, but what does this signify? To me, it signifies that America may not have been ready for its first black president. A simple thought experiment can reveal why.</p>
<p>Imagine that rather than Barack Obama, John Kerry ran a successful campaign for the presidency in 2008. The U.S. electorate would have installed yet another white male with a political background as president. Let’s also imagine that Kerry held office for two terms. It is a question worth asking as to whether a demagogue like Trump would be as appealing to the electorate as he is today. It is a question to which I think the answer is probably <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>What I believe has happened is an over-correction; the electorate, experiencing what they took to be a radical swing to the left, is overcompensating by swinging it’s public opinion far to the right. The</p>
<p>The proof is in the presidential pudding: the top 2 candidates in the home stretch of the Republican Primaries were Donald Trump and Ted Cruz — by far the most radically right-wing in terms of their public policy positions. Moderate candidates like Jeb Bush and John Kasich never had a chance.</p>
<p>There is, for sure, a case to be made that it was Obama’s push for the Affordable Care Act that pushed those even moderately on the right to go further right, into the arms of xenophobes and religious zealots. <strong><em>But we cannot ignore the irony that </em></strong><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2011/03/donald-trump-birther-051473" target="_blank"><strong><em>the very man who popularized the skepticism about Barack Obama’s citizenship</em></strong></a><strong><em> is now the effective figurehead of the Republican presidential campaign. That’s the kind of ideological swing that simply can’t be ignored.</em></strong></p>
<p>The thing about racism these days is that it’s not as explicit as it used to be. The white robes and “whites only” signs are — for the most part — faded away, but the sentiment behind them remains. That sentiment, though, has evolved into more of a distrust and skepticism, rather than outright hatred. It still informs many peoples’ opinions, and it still motivates action — and I believe we see that bearing out in the current choice of an obviously racist and xenophobic demagogue as the Republican front-runner. We may not notice an explicit pattern of reasoning whereby Trump voters leap from disliking a black president to supporting an outright bigot, but something smells fishy when a man who spent a LOT of time trying to convince us all that a black president was actually a foreigner is now a front-runner to take his place.</p>
<p>Like Yakov Smirnov once mused: <em>what a country!</em></p>

This just in from [The Art of Manliness Website](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/01/18/is-there-any-reason-to-keep-up-with-the-news/) on the phenomenon of news overload:

>And in the larger culture, consuming the news (at least the “hard,” unbiased variety — though no one can quite agree on what qualifies as such), is surely our most dignified distraction. To not keep up with current events and geopolitics (“Can you believe how many Americans don’t know the name of Canada’s prime minister?!”) is to be seen as an ignorant rube. Knowledge of the news, the thinking goes, is fundamental to being an educated, engaged citizen.
>
>Does the news really make us such though? Are our motivations for keeping up with it truly so lofty? Today we will examine these questions, as well as how large a role news consumption should play in a man’s life. At the risk of seeming heretical, I will argue that while the news is certainly not altogether worthless, we could get by with far less of it than we typically do.

>...
>to be able to make sense of the news in order know what action to take on it — requires more than the news itself. The news rarely gives context to what it reports, offering instead a ceaseless torrent of facts and data points. Background knowledge on history, psychology, philosophy, and so on, gleaned from books and other more stable, in-depth information sources, is required to make connections between these facts, stake out well-founded positions, and make sound decisions.

Boy, does this ever prove that maxim that "great minds think alike"!
I have, in my drafts folder, an article with basically the same overarching message. Take a look:

>Here’s some relief: you are not missing out. Okay, that’s a little oversimplified of an assessment. You are missing out on the intelligentsia’s version of gossip (on a global, geopolitical scale), but you’re not missing out on two key things that you should care about: understanding and wisdom.   
>
>To be connected with and aware of the transitory goings-on of current events is to have knowledge of small, discrete facts. That is what I would estimate 97% of news outlets concentrate on. But any connection to those things quickly fades. It is not understanding or wisdom; it just isn’t that valuable.

The McKays and I are on the same wavelength here, a veritable [Newton and Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy), if you will. But that won't stop me from spilling ink (pixels?) about it as well!

I have come to realize that the news is just so much uncontextualized gobbledy-gook, speculation, and ritual. It has gone well beyond its original intent of ensuring timely dissemination of vital information, and on to become a form of gossip. The real knowledge and understanding will come from the types of stories that take longer to write (beause the take longer to piece together). Which plays into a different theme that I've been thinking a lot about lately: slowing down.

Some time ago, I read Carl Honoré's book [*In Praise of Slowness*](http://www.harpercollins.com/web-sampler/9780060750510). While a lot of his suggestions and examinations are about things like work, cooking, and sex, I think our diet of information should follow suit. In other words, when it comes to collecting and acting on information, we need to slow our collective rolls. After all, one's food diet and one's information diet are a lot alike. Good health and good living begins with a good diet. Eat only when you are hungry, and eat to nourish your body, not to pass the time.

The same advice holds true for one's information diet. Good *intellectual* health starts with wisdom and understanding. But those things come not from stuffing any old information into one's mind; it comes from seeking out and digesting only nourishing information. Like food, then, the focus should be on quality, rather than quantity. And also as with food, it is worthwhile to take time to properly chew and digest information.

Godspeed.

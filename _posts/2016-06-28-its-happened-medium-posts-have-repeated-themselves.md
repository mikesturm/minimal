<p>On June 20, I finally saw it in my feed. Two posts from two well-known writers popped up in my feed. They were basically the same:</p>

<p>Shit.</p>
<p>This isn’t a good sign. Maybe I was right to check out for a while. But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is just in the zeitgeist. Maybe Holiday and Faroux were just tapped into that jetstream of inspiration. Maybe <em>The Mission</em> was launching (pun <em>fully </em>intended) a prompt for famous internet people to pen articles on the same title — except I was unable to find it (which isn’t saying much, I’ll grant you).</p>
<p>Or maybe originality — or at least a frail attempt at it — doesn’t mean anything anymore. Maybe no one will read this. Check that — no one will read this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was just thinking out loud. You can go back to whatever it was you were doing now.</p>

*The following was drafted in November of 2014, just a month before I began sending off applications to PhD programs. I was also an adjunct instructor of Philosophy at a nearby community college. Though I am no longer teaching, I stand by the message presented below.*

This past weekend, I found myself alone in Indianapolis, separated from my wife and child, and tasked with delivering a presentation at the [Community College Humanities Association Central Division conference](http://www.ccha-assoc.org/central.html). The information available at the time that I submitted my proposal was vague, but the theme of the conference was “Humanities at the Crossroads.” Given that prompt, I did what any sensible young pseudo-scholar would, I crafted a passionate, provocative presentation, aimed at drumming up discussion amongst the conference-goers. The title that I gave it at the time of the proposal (months and *months* beforehand) was *Valuating the Invaluable Humanities* (pdf of slides can be found [here](https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/272029335?access*key=key-kCuyScCKEbtzfPO0yWcI&allow*share=false&escape=false&show*recommendations=false&view*mode=scroll)). However, the more apt title is captured in one of my title slides: *A Sales-force for the Humanities*.

### The Gist

The gist of my talk was this: the paradigm of college education is shifting from what I call the “scholé paradigm” to the “market paradigm”. Each paradigm is made up of a **context** and **content**. The scholé paradigm had the context of:  


  * acceptance of the value of the content, and
  * a willingness to be enriched and explore the abstract nature of the humanities.


Students came in (mostly) without solidified goals and expectations for the education; there was an element of trust there, trust that the subject matter was meaningful and enriching — regardless of job prospects that may come from it. This trust has been lost, largely because of the change in the public discourse.   

This is the background of the market paradigm, where the context has shifted to a skepticism of the value of the content of humanities classes, as well as a set of demands that such classes be made so as to meet the demands of the students (namely, training for specific jobs), or jettisoned from the curriculum.  

Now, I could spend a lot of time spinning a Marxist-style tale about how this new paradigm is the result of the substructure of late capitalism putting pressure on those in the working class, but here is not the place. There is a call to action here, because the danger of this paradigm shift is that the *context* poses a threat to the *content* of the humanities education. If humanities educators can adapt to the changing context, we can resist a change to the content of the humanities education.  

To wit, if we change our method from erudite lecturer to engaged salesperson, we can keep Thoreau and Chaucer from being permanently replaced by Stephen Covey and Stephenie Meyer. **What I mean by this is that educators must adopt a mindset of a fully vested business person who is selling a product on full commission.**  

To some that might be bad news. It might be bad news that we, who joined the academy by and large to *escape* a life in sales, now have to essentially *be* in sale. The good news, however, is that we are selling a product that we *whole-hardheartedly* believe in. This is a luxury that few sales people have.  

My presentation closed with 3 suggestions that I lifted from the sales world:  

1. Recognize that wants are not needs. Filling a need *sells*.  
Students in this new market paradigm are focused on getting jobs; in most cases, all else is prioritized below that goal. For a student entering college today, what they want from their education is simple: good career opportunities. However, educators likely recognize that students *need* much more than just early job training — they *need* a well-rounded education. There is then a disconnect that must first be addressed and remedied before any student can be convinced of the value of the subject matter of the humanities. That gap-bridging needs to be front and center until the students and the educator are on the same page about the value of the content. In other words, the *context* must be that of selling through meeting a need, while highlighting how important the *content* is.  

2. *Telling* is not selling.  
   Questions are the most valuable tools anyone trying to sell can utilize. Since the new educational paradigm is forcing educators to sell the value of the material they teach first and foremost, questions ought to constitute a large part of the toolbox of today’s humanities educator. Asking students questions about what they are looking to do, what they value, what kind of pressure they’re under — is a great way to get an idea for what exactly will help sell the humanities to them. This should not be difficult; the great works of the humanities deal with the fundamental issues of human existence. Interestingly, human existence includes business-related subject matter — like accounting and finance — so the bulk of the student body need not fear the humanities!  

3. Speak the customers’ language, until they begin speaking yours.  
   This point is of the utmost importance in really getting buy-in from students. Acknowledge *their* feelings, *their* worries, *their* stresses, and show them that you validate them, perhaps *share* some of them. A period of doing this can be followed by linking up the material you teach with what is at the front of *their* minds. It is even easier to do this if you inject a healthy amount of discussion into class, because if done right, it will bring out even more pain points and thoughts on the students’ minds.  

One trick that I tried during my tenure teaching those beastly 2 hour 45 minute night philosophy classes at a community college was this: on the first day, as an ice-breaker, each student was asked to state for the class the following:  


  1. Their name (as they preferred it to be used in class).
  2. Where they are from (which they could interpret however they liked).
  3. The most interesting piece of advice they had heard.


Number 3 was my “in”. The advice didn’t need to be good, just *interesting*, and it need not be told to them, it could have been seen in a movie, read in a book or article, or overheard. Luckily, most of these gems (and there *were* some gems) came in the form of “shoulds” and “oughts”, which is right in the wheelhouse of ethics, and thus philosophy. After each one, I’d make a simple assessment of the advice, talk about possible pitfalls or unexpected consequences of it, and wrap it all up with a bow while showing how philosophy deals with exactly that — all punctuated with some jokes for warmth.  

The point is, getting the students to unknowingly do the work of the humanities in very rough terminology — but *their* terminology — allows for an easy inroad. Once that inroad is made, some sales can be made. Once that sale is made, students can make the sale to their parents, their communities, and the pundits who set the tone of the discussion about education in America. That’s how the humanities can survive and thrive in the new market paradigm.

*I gave this presentation on Friday afternoon, not long after a luncheon. I was very pleased with the reactions the talk received. There was some anxiety, to be sure, that things have gone this way. But there seemed to be some agreement among those in the audience, that the paradigm is shifting, and that our approach on the ground level (that is to say, the classroom) needs to change. I don’t pretend to have changed a great deal of hearts and minds, but I at least hope that I was able to plant some seeds to the effect that stealing a bit of the enemy’s tactics will not tarnish our treasure.*

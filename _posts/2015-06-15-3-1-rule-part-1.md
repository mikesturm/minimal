I hate to break it to you, but if you’re a mover-and-shaker in the business world (or fancy yourself one), then you are probably talking too much and too often. Because of this, you’re probably also missing out on countless opportunities to gain more knowledge, and thus gain the advantages necessary to do better work and to get to where you want to be. But don’t fret! This is where a little rule that I’ve bee experimenting with might come in handy. It’s called the 3:1 rule, and I believe it just might be the “one weird trick” that helps you make vast improvements in how you work.

The rule has 3 parts to it---one for choosing when to speak, and two for choosing what comes out of your mouth when you do.

## Patience Before Speaking

The urge to speak is strong and persistent, but succumbing to it quickly can often get in the way of really benefiting from conversations. When you are speaking, you are missing an opportunity to learn something. Think about it: when was the last time you learned something while *you* were talking? The answer to that questions is very likely never. The learning happens *after* you shut your trap and someone else begins talking. I’m not saying that every person is baring their soul and telling the truth when they speak (that is obviously not the case). What I *am* saying is that when others are talking---even if they’re lying---you can learn something (even if what you learn is that this person isn’t trustworthy); when you are talking, you probably can’t.

With that in mind, a simple rule can help you do this better: take a 3:1 approach to restraint in speech. The rule has 3 aspects to it, and all 3 are listed below. This last two, however, will be covered in a separate article.

1. When you’re in a conversation, and someone else finishes what they are saying, wait 3 long beats (1…2…3…) before you start the process of responding. I don’t mean that you should have your response ready and *then* wait 3 beats before you let it out of your mouth. I mean wait 3 long beats before you begin mentally putting together your statement. The purpose of this is twofold: first to allow the person who was just speaking to offer up even more information voluntarily, and secondly, to allow you to craft a more thoughtful response, or even *gasp* not speak at all. You will likely find yourself speaking less often, and in a way, that’s how you know you’re doing it right.
2. When you do speak, prioritize asking questions over making statements. Aim for a 3:1 ratio of questions to statements---3 questions for every 1 statement.
3. If you do make a statement, limit it to a maximum of 3 sentences in support of 1 main point. Think of it as an argument with a maximum of 3 premises and 1 conclusion---“I think X, because: this, that, and the other reason.”

**To sum it up:**

Wait three long beats after someone else speaks before you begin to respond. When you do speak, prioritize asking questions over making statements, aiming to ask 3 questions for each statement. But if you do make a statement limit it to 3 sentences in support of 1 main idea sentence.



## The Benefits of Waiting 3 Beats

There are three key benefits of waiting three beats before speaking. First, it ends up limiting how often you speak. Secondly, it gives you time to process what has just been said by others, and formulate a brief and meaningful response to what has been asked of you. Thirdly, it establishes a bit of distance between your emotional or impulsive thoughts (which often sneak into your statements), and allows for a more calm and collected style of conversing.

The first and most immediately noticeable effect of employing the 3:1 rule is that it limits how often you speak in situations where more than 3 people are conversing. You would be amazed at how often people actually have something additional to offer up after it *seems* like they’re finished speaking. As you begin trying out the “3 beats” wait period, you’ll notice people tacking on statements to ones they just made. Try not to look at this as an attempt to dominate the conversation (though it may well be). Look at it instead as free additional information for you, and an opportunity to gain a better understanding of both the people talking and whatever they are talking about. This is vital in contexts of speaking with co-workers about problems or visiting with clients or customers. The more you get them talking, the more valuable information you can get in order to do things better. “Telling is not selling”, as they say.

As you begin speaking less frequently, others will tend to notice, and that will tend to boost interest in what you *do* say. I first gave the the 3:1 rule a test drive after gaining notoriety in my company for being quite garrulous. I waited 3 long beats after each person in the meeting finished speaking. The discussion kept rolling without my help, as more people jumped in. I broke the rule on a few occasions only when I was confident that what I had to say had been thought out and really contributed to the conversation. Another vociferous coworker of mine took note and commented to me that I was unusually quiet. I responded that I didn’t have anything to say. He challenged me that I usually had a lot to say, to which I responded “well, I do usually *talk* a lot, but was I really *saying* anything?” That may be a bit of a cliché, but it has stuck around for a reason.

The second beneficial effect of waiting 3 beats to speak is that you give yourself more time to craft a concise and thoughtful contribution to the conversation. This will not only help you look better in conversation, but it will also enhance the quality of conversations that you have. Your quality response (or question---see part 2 of this article) will likely lead to quality responses from others in the conversation, and this becomes a dialectical process, culminating in a better end state for the exchange. As a pleasant side effect of having thought out your statements more, you’ll tend to better remember what you said, and how you said it, which tends to come in handy when a lot of information is being exchanged.

The third benefit of taking the three beat break before speaking is that it gives you a little time to cool off a passionate, emotional reaction that might bubble up during a conversation. Some exchanges can pluck the chords of emotion, and you have probably experienced the negative fallout from saying something too quickly because you felt such a strong emotion pushing you to speak. Taking 3 beats allows you to put a little distance between your *involuntary *emotional reaction and your *intentional* action of speaking. In most cases, the less that your response is serving your immediate emotions, the better. Now, 3 beats may not be enough to totally cool off before responding, but as long as others are in the conversation with you, it might be enough to let someone else make the mistake of getting worked up and blurting out something they’ll later regret.

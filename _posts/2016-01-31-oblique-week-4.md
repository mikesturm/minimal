The random pick from the deck this week graced me with a fairly easy strategy to write about, which ironically is what makes it so difficult to write anything new about it. But here goes:

>Abandon normal instruments.

It sounds like a standard best practice to "switch things up" in order to make creative breakthroughs. But though this may seem to be what this week's strategy implies, it's actually much more than "switching up". It's about identifying the instruments you chronically rely upon, and abandoning them---intentionally leaving them behind, and not just trying something else as a fling.


## Instrumentation

First of all, it should be obvious that I'm not talking about merely musical instruments here, but rather instruments in the broader sense of that term. I submit that for our purposes, there are two main types of instruments:

1. **Physical instruments** like apps, laptops, tablets, and websites you use to do work. These are the instruments that you notice while you're using them; there's a tactile or sensory experience involved. In other words, you are using the instrument, and you're quite aware that you're doing so. You're aware of a separation between yourself and the instrument that you are using to do work. For that reason, it is easy to put down physical instruments and pick up other ones.

2. **Mental instruments** like the [myriad mental models that shape the way you view the world](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/), and thus shape the way you work. These instruments are different from the physical ones because there *isn't* a tactile or sensory experience. When you're using them, you usually don't perceive a separation between yourself and the instrument. Usually, the mental model is perceived as *part* of your self, since people tend to conflate their ideas or beliefs with *who they are*---often at their own peril. That is why it is much harder to abandon mental instruments or pick up new ones.


## Abandonment

Abandoning normal instruments is not just about doing things differently---that's much too vague to be useful. It's about purposefully trying things with *different* instruments than you'd normally use, *and* taking note of the results that come form doing so.  You can start simply, by changing one of the physical instruments you use. If you normally write outlines of your writing on your computer, try using a pen and paper. On a slightly higher level, if you normally outline your thoughts before writing, use a mind map instead.

A note, however: abandoning need not mean replacing what was abandoned. It could serve you just as well to shed an instrument that may have (unbeknownst to you) been weighing you down, and then *not pick up another one*. Fewer instruments; what a concept!

What this practice of abandonment should reveal to you is a link between your process, your thoughts, and the instruments you use. It is a kind of feedback loop. The more you abandon old instruments and/or acquire new ones, the more you realize how much your instruments influence what you make, and also how you feel about the work you do. The right instruments---for a time, at least---can inspire, enthuse, and invigorate. Tired, old instruments can do just the opposite. Too few instruments can make you feel weak and uncreative, while too many can weigh you down.

Implementing this strategy is about abandoning---in the truest sense of that word. Do not just quickly and temporarily changing things up half-heartedly. Rather, leave the norms behind, with no intentions of going back (at least on this project). Ultimately, this strategy is about courage. You need to muster up the courage to truly leave behind your tried and true instruments. If you don't, they will remain in the back of your mind, calling to you, and keeping you from embracing the new way.

You may feel a tinge of fear as you fully let go of the old instruments---especially the mental ones. That is okay. Roosevelt was wrong. Fear itself is not something to fear; it is something to embrace and understand. It is the seedling of progress. Give it the water it needs.

Godspeed.

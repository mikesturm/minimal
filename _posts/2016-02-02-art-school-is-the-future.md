[Great piece on Medium a few days ago  by Dustin Toombrook:](https://medium.com/@dustintimbrook/want-your-children-to-survive-the-future-send-them-to-art-school-c88600146606#.6s9snmbd1)

>If preparing your kids for a world in which hard-working, knowledgeable people are unemployable frightens you then I have some good news. There is a solution, and it doesn’t involve tired, useless attempts at suppressing technology. Like most good solutions it requires a trait that is distinctly human.

>I’m speaking about Creativity.

He goes on to prescribe art school as a way to cultivate this trait as well as a way to prepare kids for a different kind of society---what [Ross Douthat describes as the "post work" society](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/douthat-a-world-without-work.html):

>The person with creative literacy — a basic understanding of the mental, emotional, and sociological tools used for creative thought and communication — is able to find purpose and apply meaning to her world rather than having meaning handed down and purpose assigned to her. 

Boy howdy! 

 We hear the clamor from public servants and pundits alike that engineering is the thing to do in order to get job security. Manufacturing and administrative skills are all being outsourced to emerging regions, they tell us, STEM is the future. But India, Pakistan, and other emerging economies are all churning out engineers and math whizzes by the hour. Are we really not looking that far ahead? We lost the bidding war against them for manufacturing and administrative jobs. Why do we think engineering is going to be different?

The theme of this piece is one we need to explore: the biggest bang for our educational buck is going to come from cultivating creativity.  It cannot be systematized and handed down, so it's less likely to be outsourced to other markets due to a cheaper labor rate. This should even be easy for those in the Gingrich-esque American Exceptionalism crowd to get behind.  Let's just double down on that great American creative spirit, right?! So you agree to toss some cash back toward public universities for non- STEM and non-business stuff? Great!

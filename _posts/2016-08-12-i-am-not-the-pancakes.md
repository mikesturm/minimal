## I Was a Pretty Good Cook, But…

Eight years ago, I moved into the one-bedroom apartment of the woman who would
go on to become my wife. I had presented myself as a man who liked to cook, and
considered myself good at it. My wife presented herself as a woman with a very
particular pallet. I was sure that---as had been the case before, the mere fact
that I was a man in his twenties who could whip up a decent meal, and liked
doing it---would put me over the top on the lovability scale.

But then, one morning, I decided to surprise my lady with pancakes. I had never
made homemade pancakes before. You can see where this is going. I will spare you
the gory details. Suffice it to say, it was a gory mess---literally and
figuratively. That was the first time I recall actually doing what we refer to
as “losing one’s shit” in the honeymoon of our relationship. It was bad.

During that fight I revealed what is perhaps my most long-enduring character
flaw: I am hopelessly on the defensive. That’s what anyone close to me sees, but
that’s not the disease, it’s merely a symptom. The disease is that I view my
work and my credentials as indicative of who I am as a person. I am what my job
title is, what my income is, how many followers I have, and of course, how good
the pancakes I make are.

## It Turns out I’m Just a Man

So naturally, when the pancakes I make are commented upon by the intended diners
(negatively), my mind flies into defensive mode. I *have* to explain
(man-splain?) how the perception of my pancakes is wrong, how they’re just like
the ones I saw at so-and-so restaurant, how the lighting in the kitchen must be
playing tricks with the color of the flapjacks, and on and on.

This happened again recently, and my lady life partner and I took the discussion
up to the higher level. I claimed that I just feel like I’m always being
questioned. Her admonishment to me was simple:

> I am not the pancakes I make. I am not my job title. I am not the work I do. I
> am a person, more complex than any of my achievements or failures.

For so long, I avoided agreeing with this. But doing so is probably the best
thing I can do at this point. I can’t latch my self-worth and self-esteem to
random projects, jobs, and flour-based breakfast foods. Doing so is a surefire
way to ensure that I fell terrible about myself regularly---that I feel I need
to defend myself constantly---that I’m scrambling to prove myself to the world.
I shouldn’t have to do that. Very few people should. But I know many do. So
perhaps if this piece of writing is for anyone aside from me, it is for them.

I am not the pancakes I make. I am also not myriad other things I do or fail to
do. Neither are you.

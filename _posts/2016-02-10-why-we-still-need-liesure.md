I recently finished [*Sapiens* by Yuval Noah  Harari](http://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-Humankind/dp/0062316095). It is quite good. One point that he brings up---kind of in passing---is that humans in the Paleolithic era worked much less on average than we do today. This comment came along with the statement that people of that era were much more dexterous, more skilled, and more knowledgeable about their natural surroundings than we could ever hope to be in the modern era. They were constantly interacting with the land, with its flora and fauna. Because of that constant interaction, they developed a deep knowledge and dexterity, simply because it was integral to not only living well, but merely living. 

What happened in the millennia following included two main milestones in human development: the agricultural revolution, and the industrial revolution. The former revolution preserved some of humans' connection to the environment, but made a trade-off, in which we gained more specific connections to only a portion of land, and with a select few crops. We lost, gradually, our connection with wildlife, and domestication began, thus making any relationship with animals more like one of owner and commodity. 

As humans began learning how to produce and persevere surplus food via crop yields, the time that we used to spend on leisure began to be filled by work---work to produce more crops. The hunger for surplus was only fueled by the industrial revolution, which saw amazing advances in tools and processes. These advances were fueled by the new and exciting discoveries of the post-renaissance thinkers and scientists. 

What I think goes unnoticed, or at least unnoted, is that so many of the discoveries that fueled the advances leading to the industrial revolution came because humans had leisure time. Even poor peasants had leisure time---time to think, reflect, and make intellectual headway. The modes of production and the push for growth following the industrial revolution has made leisure time all but the least affordable of luxuries. The poorest among us have little of it, and the rich often do not allow themselves much of it, lest they fall behind in their ambitious goals. 

My thought is this: I am worried that the amount of energy that we are throwing at working, and all the creativity that we are throwing at our jobs, we may be losing out on the benefits of leisure. Leisure---time with no expectations attached and no inherent goals---allows for play and free-thinking. It allows for learning for learning's sake, and for the exploration of curiosities. These benefits are not just to ourselves, but also to future generations. For it takes many generations for the benefits of leisure to culminate into true innovation and advancement. I fear that we have been riding the wave of previous centuries' leisure time dividends, and that our rate of return is thinning out, as we allow ourselves less and less to invest.
